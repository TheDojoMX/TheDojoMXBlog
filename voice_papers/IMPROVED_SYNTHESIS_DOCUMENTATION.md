# Improved Synthesis: Preserving Content Spirit

## Overview

The improved synthesis system addresses a key issue: the original synthesis treated all content as "papers" and used generic academic language that lost the spirit and character of the original content. The new system:

1. **Detects content type** (blog post, research paper, news article, etc.)
2. **Preserves tone and voice** (conversational, technical, narrative, etc.)
3. **Uses appropriate language** for each content type
4. **Maintains the author's perspective** and unique style

## Key Improvements

### 1. Content Type Detection

The system automatically detects:
- **Academic Papers**: Research studies with methodology, results, etc.
- **Blog Posts**: Personal or professional blog articles
- **News Articles**: Journalistic content
- **Technical Documentation**: How-to guides, API docs, etc.
- **Book Chapters**: Excerpts from books
- **General Text**: Other content types

### 2. Context-Aware Chunking

Instead of generic "Section 1, Section 2", chunks are labeled by their actual function:
- `introduction` - Opening sections that set context
- `methodology` - How something was done
- `results` / `findings` - What was discovered
- `discussion` / `analysis` - Interpretation and implications
- `conclusion` - Summary and takeaways
- `example` - Illustrative examples
- `main_content` - Core body content

### 3. Tone Preservation

The system detects and preserves:
- **Technical**: Precise, formal, detail-oriented
- **Conversational**: Informal, friendly, personal
- **Narrative**: Story-driven, experiential
- **Neutral**: Balanced, factual

### 4. Better Prompts

Instead of "analyze this paper", prompts now say:
- "Analyze this blog post" 
- "Extract insights from this news article"
- "Understand this technical guide"

The synthesis never refers to content as "the paper" unless it actually IS a paper.

## Usage

### Enable Improved Synthesis (Default)

```bash
voice-papers document.pdf
# or
export USE_IMPROVED_SYNTHESIS=true
```

### Use Original Synthesis

```bash
export USE_IMPROVED_SYNTHESIS=false
voice-papers document.pdf
```

## Examples

### Blog Post Detection

**Original**: "The paper states that machine learning is important..."

**Improved**: "The author shares their experience with machine learning..."

### News Article

**Original**: "The paper's methodology involves interviewing..."

**Improved**: "The reporter interviewed several experts who..."

### Technical Documentation

**Original**: "The paper presents code examples..."

**Improved**: "The guide demonstrates how to implement..."

## Implementation Details

### New Components

1. **ImprovedDocumentChunker** (`improved_chunker.py`)
   - Content type detection
   - Context-aware chunking
   - Tone analysis
   - Key concept extraction

2. **ImprovedSynthesisManager** (`improved_synthesis.py`)
   - Content-aware agents
   - Type-specific prompts
   - Voice preservation

### How It Works

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Scans first 3000 characters
   - Looks for type-specific keywords
   - Analyzes document structure

2. **Smart Chunking**
   - Respects natural boundaries
   - Labels chunks by function
   - Preserves code blocks and examples

3. **Synthesis Process**
   - Uses content-specific extraction goals
   - Maintains original voice
   - Creates authentic representation

## Benefits

### For Blog Posts
- Preserves personal anecdotes
- Keeps conversational tone
- Maintains author's personality

### For Research Papers
- Maintains academic rigor
- Preserves methodology details
- Keeps technical precision

### For News Articles
- Preserves journalistic structure
- Maintains quotes and attributions
- Keeps timeline and context

### For Technical Docs
- Preserves code examples intact
- Maintains step-by-step structure
- Keeps technical accuracy

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Enable/disable improved synthesis
export USE_IMPROVED_SYNTHESIS=true  # default

# For debugging
export SYNTHESIS_DEBUG=true  # Show detailed detection info
```

### Chunk Size

Default: 10,000 characters with 500 overlap

Can be adjusted in code:
```python
ImprovedDocumentChunker(chunk_size=15000, overlap=1000)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Let it auto-detect** - The system is good at identifying content types
2. **Check the detection** - Look for "Content type detected:" in output
3. **Review tone** - Ensure the detected tone matches your content
4. **Preserve formatting** - Use markdown for better structure detection

## Troubleshooting

### "Content detected as general_text"
- This is the fallback for unclear content
- Still provides good synthesis
- Consider adding clearer structure markers

### "Wrong tone detected"
- The system uses keyword density
- Override by setting tone explicitly in code
- Or adjust your content's language

### "Chunks too large/small"
- Adjust chunk_size parameter
- Larger chunks = more context
- Smaller chunks = more granular analysis

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- ML-based content type detection
- More content types (social media, emails, etc.)
- Language-specific tone detection
- Custom content type definitions
- User-defined preservation rules
