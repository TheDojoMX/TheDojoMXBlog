# Paper Content Variable Fix

## Problem
Error: `cannot access local variable 'paper_content' where it is not associated with a value`

This occurred when processing web URLs that weren't cached. The code extracted content into `raw_content` but later tried to use `paper_content` which was never set.

## Root Cause
In the web extraction path (`cli.py` around line 596-616), when content was freshly extracted:
```python
# This was the problematic code:
title, raw_content = extract_text_from_url(input_source)
paper_title = title
# paper_content was NOT set here!

# Later in the code (line 799+):
click.echo(f"üìä Document length: {len(paper_content):,} characters")  # ERROR!
```

## Solution
Added one line to set `paper_content` after web extraction:
```python
title, raw_content = extract_text_from_url(input_source)
paper_title = title
# Set paper_content to the raw content for web articles
paper_content = raw_content  # ‚Üê THIS FIX
```

## Code Flow

The variable `paper_content` is used in several places after extraction:
1. Line 799: Display document length
2. Line 808: Pass to `run_summary_workflow()`
3. Line 821: Topic detection
4. Line 731: Save to project directory

## Testing

Use `test_paper_content_fix.py` to verify:
```bash
# Test basic flow
python test_paper_content_fix.py

# Test with multiple URLs
python test_paper_content_fix.py --urls
```

## Affected Scenarios

This fix resolves the error for:
1. **Fresh web extraction** - When URL is processed for the first time
2. **Cache cleared** - When web cache is deleted and URL is re-processed
3. **New URLs** - Any URL that hasn't been cached yet

## Not Affected

These scenarios were already working:
1. **Cached web content** - Second run of same URL
2. **PDF files** - Different code path
3. **Text files** - Different code path
4. **Direct mode** - Different code path

## Key Lesson

When extracting content from different sources (web, PDF, text), ensure all code paths set the same variables that will be used later in the common processing flow.
