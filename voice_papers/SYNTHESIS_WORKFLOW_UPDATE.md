# Synthesis Workflow Update

## Overview

The Voice Papers workflow has been updated to **always create a comprehensive synthesis** of the document before any other processing. This ensures that all information and essence from the original document is captured and preserved before the multi-agent discussion begins.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Default Workflow

**Before**: Document → Multi-agent discussion → Educational script

**Now**: Document → **Synthesis** → Multi-agent discussion → Educational script

### 2. Key Benefits

- **Complete Information Capture**: The synthesis step uses chunking to analyze documents section by section, ensuring no important details are lost
- **Better Context**: Multi-agent discussions now work with a comprehensive synthesis rather than raw content
- **Reusability**: Synthesis is saved and can be reused in future runs
- **Consistency**: All workflows now benefit from the same deep document understanding

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### New Method: `create_synthesis()`
- Chunks the document into manageable sections (10,000 chars with 200 char overlap)
- Analyzes each chunk individually with a Deep Document Analyzer
- Combines all analyses with a Master Synthesizer
- Saves synthesis for reuse

#### Updated Method: `create_crew_for_paper()`
- Now accepts `use_synthesis` parameter (default: True)
- Automatically creates synthesis before multi-agent discussion
- Uses synthesis content instead of raw content for discussions

#### New Storage Structure
```
project_name/
├── discussion/          # Multi-agent discussion outputs
├── synthesis/          # NEW: Synthesis outputs
│   ├── synthesis_output.txt
│   ├── synthesis_metadata.json
│   └── chunk_X_analysis.txt
└── educational_script.txt
```

## Usage

### Default Behavior (Synthesis Enabled)
```bash
voice-papers path/to/paper.pdf
```
This will:
1. Extract text from PDF
2. **Create comprehensive synthesis** (NEW)
3. Run multi-agent discussion using synthesis
4. Generate educational script

### Skip Synthesis (Legacy Mode)
```bash
voice-papers path/to/paper.pdf --skip-synthesis
```
This uses the old workflow without synthesis step.

### Summary Mode (Unchanged)
```bash
voice-papers path/to/paper.pdf --summary
```
This still creates synthesis but skips multi-agent discussion, going directly to educational script.

## Workflow Comparison

| Mode | Steps | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Default (NEW)** | Document → Synthesis → Multi-agent → Script | Full analysis with synthesis |
| Summary | Document → Synthesis → Script | Faster, skip discussion |
| Direct | Text → Script | Pre-processed content |
| Legacy | Document → Multi-agent → Script | Old behavior (--skip-synthesis) |

## Example Output

When running with the new default workflow, you'll see:

```
🔬 NEW DEFAULT: Creating comprehensive synthesis before discussion...
📊 Document chunked into 8 sections for deep analysis...
📑 Sections found:
   • Abstract
   • Introduction
   • Methodology
   • Results
   • Discussion
   • Conclusion
   • References
   • Appendix
🔬 Running deep document analysis and synthesis...
✅ Synthesis completed and saved
🤖 Setting up AI crew...
🗣️ Running discussion (this may take several minutes)...
```

## Notes

- Synthesis is cached: If you run the same project again, it will reuse the existing synthesis
- The synthesis preserves technical depth while organizing content coherently
- Multi-agent discussions now have better context and produce richer insights
- All agent prompts have been updated to work with synthesis instead of raw content
