# Audio Generation Improvements Summary

## Problem Solved

The ElevenLabs API was failing when generating audio longer than ~10 minutes, causing the entire generation process to fail and losing all progress. This was particularly problematic for educational scripts that typically run 15-30 minutes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Duration-Based Chunking**
- Changed from character-based limits to duration-based limits
- Flash/Turbo models now use 18,000 character chunks (~5-6 minutes of audio)
- Prevents API timeouts by keeping each request under 10 minutes
- Maintains voice consistency using request stitching (passing previous request IDs)

### 2. **State Management & Recovery**
- Created `ElevenLabsImprovedSynthesizer` class with full state tracking
- Saves progress after each chunk in `.{filename}_state/` directory
- Can resume from failures without regenerating completed chunks
- Stores:
  - Generation state (JSON)
  - Individual audio chunks (MP3)
  - Cost tracking information
  - Request IDs for voice consistency

### 3. **Cost Tracking & Reporting**
- Calculates cost per chunk based on character count and model pricing
- Generates detailed cost report with:
  - Total cost
  - Cost per chunk
  - Character count
  - Estimated audio duration
- Pricing data:
  - Flash: $0.33/1M chars
  - Turbo: $0.50/1M chars
  - Multilingual: $0.90/1M chars

### 4. **Improved Reliability**
- Automatic retry logic for timeouts (3 attempts with backoff)
- Chunk-by-chunk processing with immediate state saves
- Two audio stitching methods:
  - Primary: pydub (seamless audio joining)
  - Fallback: direct file concatenation
- Clear progress indicators and error messages

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. `voice_papers/voice/elevenlabs_improved.py` - Improved synthesizer implementation
2. `IMPROVED_AUDIO_GENERATION.md` - User documentation
3. `test_improved_audio.py` - Test script for verification

### Modified Files
1. `voice_papers/voice/synthesizer.py` - Added integration with improved synthesizer
2. `voice_papers/cli.py` - Added `--use-legacy-tts` flag
3. `pyproject.toml` - Added pydub dependency

### CLI Changes
```bash
# Default (uses improved synthesizer)
voice-papers document.pdf

# Legacy mode (original behavior)
voice-papers document.pdf --use-legacy-tts
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Chunking
```python
DURATION_BASED_LIMITS = {
    "eleven_flash_v2_5": 18000,  # ~5-6 minutes
    "eleven_turbo_v2_5": 18000,  # ~5-6 minutes
    # Multilingual keeps original 9500 limit
}
```

### State File Structure
```json
{
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "status": "completed",
  "total_chunks": 4,
  "completed_chunks": ["chunk_000", "chunk_001", ...],
  "total_cost": 0.024,
  "chunks_info": [...]
}
```

### Directory Structure
```
project/
├── educational_lecture.mp3        # Final stitched audio
└── .educational_lecture_state/    # State directory
    ├── synthesis_state_xxx.json   # Progress tracking
    ├── cost_report.txt           # Detailed costs
    └── chunks/                   # Individual chunks
        ├── chunk_000.mp3
        ├── chunk_001.mp3
        └── ...
```

## Benefits

1. **No more failures on long scripts** - Can handle any length
2. **Resume from failures** - Don't lose completed work
3. **Cost transparency** - Know exactly what you're spending
4. **Better debugging** - Clear state and progress tracking
5. **Backwards compatible** - Legacy mode available if needed

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python test_improved_audio.py
```

This creates a ~15-minute test script and shows how it would be processed.

## Recommendations

1. Always use the improved mode (default) for scripts > 5 minutes
2. Install pydub for seamless audio: `pip install pydub`
3. Keep state directories until generation is complete
4. Monitor cost reports for API usage
5. Use `--script-only` first to verify content length

## Technical Notes

- Request stitching maintains voice consistency across chunks
- Character limit of 18,000 is based on ~150 words/minute speech rate
- State files use MD5 hash of content for unique job IDs
- Chunks are processed sequentially with delays to avoid rate limits
- Cost calculation uses official ElevenLabs pricing as of 2024
