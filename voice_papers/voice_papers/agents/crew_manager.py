            Your job is to distill ALL this rich content into a single educator voice.
            
            The script MUST follow the Voice Papers style guide structure:
            
            1. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (from style guide):
               - START with one of these hook types, not exactly, just use the style guide:
                 ‚Ä¢ Escenario relatable: "Digamos que est√°s planeando unas vacaciones con tu familia..."
                 ‚Ä¢ Contexto hist√≥rico: "En octubre de 1997, en Atlanta Georgia..."
                 ‚Ä¢ Alarma/problema: "Si eres como yo, ya te est√°n sonando las alarmas..."
                 ‚Ä¢ Pregunta intrigante: "¬øAlguna vez te has preguntado por qu√©...?"
               - THEN naturally introduce "{paper_title}" after the hook, if not stated explicitly do not use it
               - Structure as three acts when possible: Problema ‚Üí Soluci√≥n ‚Üí Implicaciones
               - NEVER start with: "En resumen", "Hoy vamos a hablar de", "Este es un resumen de"
            
            2. CONVERSATIONAL TONE (Voice Papers style):
               - Written as a SINGLE EDUCATOR speaking directly (use "t√∫"/"usted")
               - Use frequent rhetorical questions: "¬øParece simple, no?", "¬øTe suena familiar?"
               - Show personality: "En mi opini√≥n...", "Lo que m√°s me sorprende es..."
            3. TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS (Voice Papers layered approach):
               - Start with the simplest version of the concept
               - Add complexity gradually in layers
               - Define terms naturally in flow: "esto se llama X, que b√°sicamente significa..."
               - Use MINIMUM 2-3 analogies per script from everyday life
            
            4. RHYTHM AND FLOW (style guide requirements):
               - Mix sentence lengths: short for impact, long for explanation
               - Natural transitions: "Ahora bien...", "Pero aqu√≠ est√° lo interesante..."
               - Create expectation: "En un momento veremos algo sorprendente..."
               - Strategic pauses and emphasis for voice delivery
            
            5. STORYTELLING (academic narrative from style guide):
               - Humanize when possible: "Los investigadores se sorprendieron cuando..."
               - Create narrative tension before revealing findings
            
            6. CORE REQUIREMENTS:
               - Include ALL key insights from conversations and specialist exchanges
               - Flow naturally with smooth transitions between concepts
               - Write as continuous text for voice actor (no headers/formatting)
               - Address listener directly: "puedes imaginar", "te dar√°s cuenta"
               - End with practical implications and thought-provoking questions
               - Incorporate depth from ALL agent conversations
            
            STYLE GUIDE CHECKLIST - ALL ITEMS MANDATORY:
            ‚úì Hook: Used one of the 4 exact types from style guide?
            ‚úì Direct address: Speaking to "t√∫" throughout?
            ‚úì Transitions: Natural connectors between ideas?
            ‚úì Rhythm: Varied sentence lengths for flow?
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC STRUCTURE:
            - INTRODUCTION: Hook ‚Üí Title ‚Üí Preview ("En los pr√≥ximos minutos descubrir√°s...")
            - DEVELOPMENT: Layered explanations with examples
            - CONCLUSION: Clear recap ("Hemos visto que...", "Para cerrar...")
            - The script should not be necessarily inspirational, it should be a technical explanation of content
            NATURAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
            - AVOID: fundamental, crucial, esencial, revelador, fascinante, delve, robust <- THIS IS MANDATORY
            - USE: importante, interesante, sorprendente, resulta que, descubrimos que
            - Sound like explaining to a curious friend, not generating content
            
            CRITICAL - MULTI-SPECIALIST INTEGRATION:
            19. Weave in insights that could ONLY come from having multiple specialist perspectives
            20. Include cross-disciplinary connections discovered during discussions
            21. Incorporate domain-specific knowledge from ALL participating specialists

            The script MUST follow the Voice Papers style guide:
            
            1. NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (mandatory from style guide):
               - Hook: Use one of the 4 exact types (escenario, hist√≥rico, alarma, pregunta)
               - Development: Three acts when possible (Problema ‚Üí Soluci√≥n ‚Üí Implicaciones)
               - Closure: Practical conclusions with future vision
            
            2. CONVERSATIONAL ELEMENTS (required):
               - Single educator voice speaking directly ("t√∫"/"usted")
               - Rhetorical questions throughout: "¬øNo es sorprendente?"
               - Personal touches: "En mi opini√≥n...", "Me fascina que..."
               - Direct address: "puedes imaginar", "te dar√°s cuenta"
            
            3. TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS (layered approach):
               - Start simple, add complexity gradually
               - Define terms naturally in flow
               - Minimum 2-3 everyday analogies
               - Connect abstract to concrete
            
            4. ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:
               - Create expectation and suspense
               - Guide thinking with questions
               - Include "aha!" moments
               - Moments of wonder and curiosity
            
            5. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
               - Include ALL specialist perspectives
               - Show cross-disciplinary connections
               - Weave insights naturally (not "experts said")
               - Write as YOU teaching, not summarizing
            
            6. FORMAT:
               - Continuous text for voice (no headers/marks)
               - Natural flow between concepts
               - End with practical implications and questions
               - Plain text optimized for speech
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES - MANDATORY:
            21. INTRODUCTION must include a compelling preview/roadmap: Start with an engaging hook and then preview what the listener will learn - "En los pr√≥ximos minutos vas a descubrir...", "Te voy a mostrar tres ideas que cambiar√°n tu forma de pensar sobre...", etc.
            22. CONCLUSION must include a clear summary: End with a recap of the main points covered - "Hemos visto que...", "En resumen, tres puntos clave...", "Para cerrar, recordemos que...", etc.
            23. AVOID TYPICAL LLM WORDS: Never use overused AI-generated words like "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (as adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "delve into", "explore", "unpack", "dive deep", "robust", "compelling", etc.
            24. USE NATURAL LANGUAGE: Instead of LLM words, use conversational alternatives like "importante", "interesante", "sorprendente", "nos ayuda a entender", "vamos a ver", "resulta que", "descubrimos que", etc.
            25. SOUND HUMAN: Write as if explaining to a friend over coffee, not as if generating academic content
