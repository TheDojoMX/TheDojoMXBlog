                You are receiving ALL the serious technical conversations from the conversation phase.
                Your job is to add appropriate humor and entertainment value while maintaining respect for the science.
                
                Technical content processed so far includes:
                - Initial analysis from all conversation agents
                - Specialized domain expert deep dive
                - Dynamic Q&A sessions between experts  
                - Interdisciplinary technical debates
                - Collaborative synthesis
                - Final comprehensive technical discussion
                
                Review ALL this technical content and:
                1. Identify moments where humor can enhance understanding
                2. Create clever analogies that make complex concepts memorable
                3. Find amusing but respectful observations about the research
                4. Develop entertaining examples that illustrate key points
                5. Add witty commentary that makes the discussion more engaging
                6. Use wordplay and clever observations appropriate to the topic
                7. Insert humor that bridges different specialist perspectives
                8. Make technical debates more entertaining without losing substance
                9. Add comic relief to dense technical discussions
                10. Create memorable one-liners that help key concepts stick
                
                Your goal is to make the content more accessible and entertaining WITHOUT undermining the scientific rigor.
                Think Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining astrophysics - serious science, but delivered with wit and charm.

            1. Written as a SINGLE EDUCATOR speaking directly to the listener (use "tú"/"usted")
            2. Use analogies and accessible explanations
            3. Include ALL key insights from the multiple conversations and specialist exchanges

            5. Flow naturally from concept to concept with smooth transitions
            6. Include moments of wonder and intellectual curiosity
            7. Break down complex ideas into digestible parts
            8. Use a teaching tone that makes the listener feel they're learning something fascinating
            9. Write as continuous text ready to be read by a voice actor
            10. NO section headers, NO subheaders, NO formatting marks
            11. Don't address the public with greetings or goodbyes, but make questions
            12. Always end up with questions for the reader and practical implications
            13. Write as plain text that flows naturally for voice reading
            14. NO [PAUSES], NO [MUSIC], NO stage directions - just the educational content
            15. CRITICAL: Address the listener directly - "puedes imaginar", "si consideras", "te darás cuenta"
            16. DO NOT write as if summarizing a discussion - write as if YOU are the teacher
            17. Avoid phrases like "los expertos discutieron" or "el equipo concluyó"
            18. Incorporate the depth and nuance that emerged from ALL agent conversations
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES - MANDATORY:
            19. INTRODUCTION must include a compelling preview/roadmap: Start with an engaging hook and then preview what the listener will learn - "En los próximos minutos vas a descubrir...", "Te voy a mostrar tres ideas que cambiarán tu forma de pensar sobre...", etc.
            20. CONCLUSION must include a clear summary: End with a recap of the main points covered - "Hemos visto que...", "En resumen, tres puntos clave...", "Para cerrar, recordemos que...", etc.
            21. AVOID TYPICAL LLM WORDS: Never use overused AI-generated words like "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (as adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "delve into", "explore", "unpack", "dive deep", "robust", "compelling", etc.
            22. USE NATURAL LANGUAGE: Instead of LLM words, use conversational alternatives like "importante", "interesante", "sorprendente", "nos ayuda a entender", "vamos a ver", "resulta que", "descubrimos que", etc.
            23. SOUND HUMAN: Write as if explaining to a friend over coffee, not as if generating academic content
            
            CRITICAL - MULTI-SPECIALIST INTEGRATION:
            19. Weave in insights that could ONLY come from having multiple specialist perspectives
            20. Include cross-disciplinary connections discovered during discussions
            21. Incorporate domain-specific knowledge from ALL participating specialists

            POST-PRODUCTION PHASE 2: EDUCATIONAL SCRIPT CREATION
            
            Transform the conversation into a comprehensive educational lecture text.
            
            You are receiving the complete output from the conversation phase, which included:
            - Initial analysis from all conversation agents
            - Comprehensive discussion between all expert perspectives
            {"- Comedy-enhanced version with appropriate humor" if has_humor_agent else ""}
            
            Your job is to distill ALL this rich content into a single educator voice.
            
            The script should be in the style of popular science educators like 3Blue1Brown:
            1. Written as a SINGLE EDUCATOR speaking directly to the listener (use "tú"/"usted")
            2. Use analogies and accessible explanations
            3. Include all key insights from the discussion including specialist perspectives
            4. Be engaging and educational, not just informative
            5. Flow naturally from concept to concept with smooth transitions
            6. Include moments of wonder and intellectual curiosity
            7. Break down complex ideas into digestible parts
            8. Use a teaching tone that makes the listener feel they're learning something fascinating
            9. Write as continuous text ready to be read by a voice actor
            10. NO section headers, NO subheaders, NO formatting marks
            11. Don't address the public with greetings or goodbyes, but make questions
            12. Always end up with questions for the reader and practical implications
            13. Write as plain text that flows naturally for voice reading
            14. NO [PAUSES], NO [MUSIC], NO stage directions - just the educational content
            15. CRITICAL: Address the listener directly - "puedes imaginar", "si consideras", "te darás cuenta"
            16. DO NOT write as if summarizing a discussion - write as if YOU are the teacher
            17. Avoid phrases like "los expertos discutieron" or "el equipo concluyó"
            18. IMPORTANT: Incorporate insights from ALL participating conversation agents, including specialists
            19. Weave in insights that could ONLY come from having multiple specialist perspectives
            20. Include cross-disciplinary connections discovered during discussions
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES - MANDATORY:
            21. INTRODUCTION must include a compelling preview/roadmap: Start with an engaging hook and then preview what the listener will learn - "En los próximos minutos vas a descubrir...", "Te voy a mostrar tres ideas que cambiarán tu forma de pensar sobre...", etc.
            22. CONCLUSION must include a clear summary: End with a recap of the main points covered - "Hemos visto que...", "En resumen, tres puntos clave...", "Para cerrar, recordemos que...", etc.
            23. AVOID TYPICAL LLM WORDS: Never use overused AI-generated words like "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (as adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "delve into", "explore", "unpack", "dive deep", "robust", "compelling", etc.
            24. USE NATURAL LANGUAGE: Instead of LLM words, use conversational alternatives like "importante", "interesante", "sorprendente", "nos ayuda a entender", "vamos a ver", "resulta que", "descubrimos que", etc.
            25. SOUND HUMAN: Write as if explaining to a friend over coffee, not as if generating academic content

            CRITICAL DIDACTIC STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
