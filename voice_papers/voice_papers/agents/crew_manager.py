            - The main argument or discovery in one sentence
            - 2-3 key findings or insights
            - The primary implication or takeaway
            
            After the TLDR, provide the rich, detailed synthesis that someone could use to deeply understand this paper.
            This is not a simple summary - it's a comprehensive analysis that preserves the intellectual
            depth while organizing it coherently.
            
            Remember: You're creating the foundation that will be used by all subsequent analyses,

            CRITICAL DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES - MANDATORY:

            21. CONCLUSION must include a clear summary: End with a recap of the main points covered - "Hemos visto que...", "Los tres puntos clave que exploramos fueron...", "Para cerrar, recordemos que...", etc. ("En resumen" is ONLY acceptable here in conclusions)
            22. AVOID TYPICAL LLM WORDS: Never use overused AI-generated words like "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (as adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "delve into", "explore", "unpack", "dive deep", "robust", "compelling", etc.
            23. USE NATURAL LANGUAGE: Instead of LLM words, use conversational alternatives like "importante", "interesante", "sorprendente", "nos ayuda a entender", "vamos a ver", "resulta que", "descubrimos que", etc.
            24. SOUND HUMAN: Write as if explaining to a friend over coffee, not as if generating academic content
            
            CRITICAL - MULTI-SPECIALIST INTEGRATION:
            19. Weave in insights that could ONLY come from having multiple specialist perspectives
            20. Include cross-disciplinary connections discovered during discussions
            21. Incorporate domain-specific knowledge from ALL participating specialists

            MANDATORY VOICE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Create a SINGLE, CONTINUOUS text ready for a voice actor to read
            2. Markdown formatting, but NO headers, NO bullet points, NO lists
            3. Convert ALL content into natural, flowing sentences

            5. Ensure PERFECT flow from sentence to sentence
            6. Remove formatting marks: #, -, ‚Ä¢, etc for titles and subtitles, but keep for bold and italic text
            7. Make sure sentences are not too long or complex for voice delivery
            8. Write naturally in {self.language} without academic formalities
            9. Remove any remaining conversational artifacts ("como mencionamos antes", "en nuestra discusi√≥n")
            10. Ensure seamless transitions between concepts
            11. Maintain the conversational richness but in a single educator voice

            16. Perfect pacing for natural speech rhythm
            17. Eliminate any phrases that sound like committee work or group consensus
            18. Make it sound like ONE expert who has deeply understood the topic
            19. Ensure technical accuracy while maintaining conversational flow
            20. Optimize for voice actor performance and listener engagement
            21. This should sound like ONE VOICE teaching, not a summary of multiple voices
            22. Avoid words that could make this sound like written by an LLM, like not often used words: "fascinante", "delve", "revelador"
            23. CRITICAL INTRODUCTION VERIFICATION:
                a) MUST start with a catchy hook (question, surprising fact, intriguing statement)
                b) NEVER start with "En resumen", "Hoy vamos a hablar de", "Este es un resumen de"
                c) The title/topic should be mentioned AFTER the hook, integrated naturally
                d) If the script starts with "En resumen" or similar, REWRITE the entire introduction
            24. DO NOT add new content - only optimize existing content for voice delivery
            25. DO NOT change the educational message - only improve its delivery
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
            26. VERIFY INTRODUCTION includes preview/roadmap: Ensure there's a clear "what you'll learn" section early in the script (AFTER the hook and title mention)
            27. VERIFY CONCLUSION includes summary: Ensure there's a clear recap of main points at the end ("En resumen" is ONLY acceptable in conclusions)
            28. REMOVE LLM WORDS: Replace any remaining "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "compelling", "robust", etc. with natural alternatives
            29. HUMAN CONVERSATION: Ensure the entire script sounds like a knowledgeable person explaining something interesting, not AI-generated content
            30. NATURAL FLOW: Check that didactic elements (preview, summary) flow naturally within the content, not as forced additions
            31. HOOK QUALITY CHECK: The opening sentence should immediately grab attention - if it doesn't, rewrite it

            4. Replace any remaining bullet points with complete sentences
            5. Ensure PERFECT flow from sentence to sentence
            6. Remove formatting marks: #, -, ‚Ä¢, etc for titles and subtitles, but keep for bold and italic text
            7. Make sure sentences are not too long or complex for voice delivery
            8. Write naturally in {self.language} without academic formalities
            9. Remove any remaining conversational artifacts ("como mencionamos antes", "en nuestra discusi√≥n")
            10. Ensure seamless transitions between concepts
            11. Maintain the conversational richness but in a single educator voice
            12. Read the text mentally to ensure it sounds natural when spoken
            13. Ensure proper pronunciation flow for difficult technical terms
            14. Remove any repetitive content that may have emerged from multiple discussions
            15. Maintain the depth gained from agent conversations while ensuring clarity
            16. Perfect pacing for natural speech rhythm
            17. Eliminate any phrases that sound like committee work or group consensus
            18. Make it sound like ONE expert who has deeply understood the topic
            19. Ensure technical accuracy while maintaining conversational flow
            20. Optimize for voice actor performance and listener engagement
            21. This should sound like ONE VOICE teaching, not a summary of multiple voices
            22. Avoid words that could make this sound like written by an LLM, like not often used words: "fascinante", "delve", "revelador"
            23. CRITICAL INTRODUCTION VERIFICATION:
                a) MUST start with a catchy hook (question, surprising fact, intriguing statement)
                b) NEVER start with "En resumen", "Hoy vamos a hablar de", "Este es un resumen de"
                c) The title/topic should be mentioned AFTER the hook, integrated naturally
                d) If the script starts with "En resumen" or similar, REWRITE the entire introduction
            24. DO NOT add new content - only optimize existing content for voice delivery
            25. DO NOT change the educational message - only improve its delivery
            
            CRITICAL DIDACTIC STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
            26. VERIFY INTRODUCTION includes preview/roadmap: Ensure there's a clear "what you'll learn" section early in the script (AFTER the hook and title mention)
            27. VERIFY CONCLUSION includes summary: Ensure there's a clear recap of main points at the end ("En resumen" is ONLY acceptable in conclusions)
            28. REMOVE LLM WORDS: Replace any remaining "fundamental", "crucial", "clave" (adjective), "esencial", "revelador", "fascinante", "compelling", "robust", etc. with natural alternatives
            29. HUMAN CONVERSATION: Ensure the entire script sounds like a knowledgeable person explaining something interesting, not AI-generated content
            30. NATURAL FLOW: Check that didactic elements (preview, summary) flow naturally within the content, not as forced additions
            31. HOOK QUALITY CHECK: The opening sentence should immediately grab attention - if it doesn't, rewrite it
            {"31. Preserve the humor elements but ensure they flow naturally in speech" if has_humor_agent else ""}

                1. **Preserves Depth**: Keep important technical details, evidence, and nuanced arguments
                2. **Shows Connections**: How do different sections relate and build on each other?
                3. **Identifies Key Themes**: What are the main threads running through the paper?
                4. **Highlights Insights**: What are the most important findings and breakthroughs?

                CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - START WITH A TLDR:
                Begin your synthesis with a "TLDR:" section (3-5 bullet points) that captures:
                - The main argument or discovery in one sentence
                - 2-3 key findings or insights
                - The primary implication or takeaway
                
                After the TLDR, provide the rich, detailed synthesis that someone could use to deeply understand this paper.
                This is not a simple summary - it's a comprehensive analysis that preserves the intellectual
                depth while organizing it coherently.
