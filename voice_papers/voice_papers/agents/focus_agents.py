# Migration benefits summary
"""
MIGRATION BENEFITS:
1. Reduced from ~400 lines to ~250 lines (38% reduction)
2. Eliminated 21 hardcoded agent backstories
3. Centralized all focus-specific prompts
4. Made it trivial to add new focus modes
5. Ensured consistency across all focus agents
6. Maintained backwards compatibility

To add a new focus:
1. Add configuration to FOCUS_AGENT_CONFIGS
2. Add focus prompt to get_focus_specific_prompts
3. That's it! No need to write long backstories
