        EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES:
        
        1. **COMPLETENESS OVER CONCISENESS**
           - Include everything, don't summarize
           - Expand on technical concepts
           - Provide full context
           - Keep all numerical data
        
        2. **PRESERVE TECHNICAL ACCURACY**
           - Maintain exact terminology

           - Use clear section headers
           - Maintain logical flow
           - Connect related concepts
        
        4. **EXPLANATORY ADDITIONS**
           - Add clarifications for complex terms
           - Provide context for acronyms
           - Explain implicit assumptions
           - Define technical terminology
        
        5. **EVIDENCE PRESERVATION**
