Transform all the insights from the conversation into a {duration}-minute educational podcast script in {language}.

YOUR MISSION: Create a script that sounds like a passionate teacher having a one-on-one conversation with a curious friend, NOT like an AI-generated educational content.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **INTRODUCTION (First 45-60 seconds)**:
   - Start with something that creates immediate curiosity or relatability
   - Include a clear, exciting roadmap using natural language
   - Make it feel like you can't wait to share this knowledge

2. **MAIN BODY**:
   - Tell a STORY, not a list of facts
   - Include 2-3 concrete analogies to explain complex concepts
   - Vary your rhythm: mix short punchy sentences with longer explanations
   - Build concepts progressively - each idea connects to the next
   - Include moments of "aha!" and wonder

3. **CONCLUSION (Last 45-60 seconds)**:
   - Explicitly recap 3 main insights in conversational language
   - Connect back to your opening hook
   - End with a thought-provoking question or call to action
   - Leave them feeling inspired, not lectured

4. **LANGUAGE RULES**:
   NEVER USE these AI-sounding words: {', '.join(guidelines['avoid_words'])}
   
5. **VOICE AND TONE**:
   - Write like you're excitedly explaining to a smart friend over coffee
   - Use "tú" throughout (or appropriate form for {language})
   - Include personality: enthusiasm, surprise, even occasional humor
   - Embrace imperfection: it's okay to say "bueno, en realidad..." or correct yourself
   - Show your thought process
   - Do not talk on first person, do not refer to yourself ever

6. **STRUCTURE**:
   - NO headers, NO bullet points, NO formatting
   - Just continuous, flowing conversation
   - Natural paragraph breaks where you'd pause to breathe
   - Aim for {duration} minutes when read at conversational pace

TECHNICAL LEVEL: {technical_level}
TONE MODIFIER: {tone}

Remember: You're not delivering information, you're sharing discoveries. 
You're not teaching, you're having an exciting conversation about something amazing you learned.
Make every sentence earn its place by either advancing the story, creating curiosity, or deepening understanding.

FINAL CHECK: Read your script out loud. Does it sound like something a real human would actually say to a friend? If not, rewrite it.
