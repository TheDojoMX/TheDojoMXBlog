# Migration Summary: Educational Writer

## ‚úÖ Migration Complete!

### Before & After

- **Original file**: 221 lines
- **Migrated file**: 90 lines
- **Reduction**: **59%** (131 lines removed!)

### What Changed

1. **Agent Backstory**
   - ‚ùå Before: 20+ lines hardcoded in the function
   - ‚úÖ After: Composed from `system_prompts.EDUCATIONAL_WRITER`

2. **Avoided Words**
   - ‚ùå Before: 25+ hardcoded words in the file
   - ‚úÖ After: Pulled from `constraints.UNIVERSAL_AVOIDED_WORDS`

3. **Task Instructions**
   - ‚ùå Before: 130+ lines of hardcoded prompt template
   - ‚úÖ After: Single call to `TaskPrompts.educational_writing_task()`

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Update prompts in ONE place
2. **Consistency**: Shared constraints across all agents
3. **Readability**: 59% less code to read
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to create variations

### The New Pattern

```python
# 1. Import centralized system
from .prompts import PromptComposer, TaskPrompts

# 2. Compose agent backstory
backstory = composer.compose_agent_prompt(
    agent_type="educational_writer",
    focus="explanatory",
    language="Spanish",
    tone="academic",
    additional_context="[unique aspects only]"
)

# 3. Use centralized task prompts
task = TaskPrompts.educational_writing_task(
    title=title,
    content=content,
    language=language,
    duration=duration,
    focus=focus,
    tone=tone
)
```

### Next Agents to Migrate

1. `technical_writer.py` - Similar pattern
2. `conversational_enhancer.py` - Can share constraints
3. `focus_agents.py` - Many agents can use same base
4. `crew_manager.py` - Remove hardcoded prompts

The centralized system is working perfectly! üéâ
