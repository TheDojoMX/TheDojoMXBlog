# Hook Improvements for Educational Scripts

## Changes Made

### 1. Educational Writer Phase Updates (`crew_manager.py`)

Updated the Educational Writer task to ensure proper introduction structure:

- **START with a HOOK**: Scripts must begin with a question, surprising fact, or intriguing statement
- **NEVER start with**: "En resumen", "Hoy vamos a hablar de", "Este es un resumen de"
- **Title mention**: The document title should be mentioned AFTER the hook, integrated naturally
- **Good hook examples**: 
  - "Â¿Alguna vez te has preguntado...?"
  - "Imagina por un momento..."
  - "Hay algo sorprendente sobre..."

### 2. Voice Director Phase Updates (`crew_manager.py`)

Enhanced the Voice Director verification to catch and fix problematic introductions:

- **Critical Introduction Verification**: Added explicit checks for hook quality
- **Rewrite requirement**: If script starts with "En resumen" or similar, the entire introduction must be rewritten
- **Hook quality check**: The opening sentence must immediately grab attention
- **"En resumen" placement**: Only acceptable in conclusions, never at the beginning

### 3. Improved Educational Writer Updates (`improved_educational_writer.py`)

Updated the improved educational writer with:

- **Explicit hook requirement** in the introduction structure
- **Added `avoid_at_start` list** with problematic opening phrases:
  - "En resumen"
  - "Hoy vamos a hablar de"
  - "Este es un resumen de"
  - "En este episodio"
  - "Hoy exploramos"
  - "Vamos a analizar"

## Expected Results

Scripts will now:

1. **Start with an engaging hook** that immediately captures attention
2. **Naturally introduce the title** after engaging the listener
3. **Avoid formulaic openings** that sound like AI-generated summaries
4. **Save "En resumen"** for conclusions where it's appropriate
5. **Sound more human and conversational** from the very first sentence

## Testing

Created `test_hook_improvement.py` to verify:
- Scripts don't start with problematic phrases
- Scripts begin with proper hooks
- Titles are mentioned after the hook
- Overall introduction quality

## Key Improvements

1. **Better engagement**: Listeners are hooked from the first sentence
2. **More natural flow**: Topics are introduced conversationally
3. **Avoided AI patterns**: No more formulaic "En resumen" openings
4. **Preserved title inclusion**: Titles are still mentioned, just more naturally
5. **Human-like delivery**: Scripts sound like a passionate teacher, not an AI summary
