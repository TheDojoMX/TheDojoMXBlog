# TLDR Feature for Synthesis

## Overview

All synthesis outputs now begin with a TLDR (Too Long; Didn't Read) section that provides a quick summary of the key points before the detailed analysis.

## Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `create_synthesis` task in `crew_manager.py`**:
   - Added TLDR requirement to synthesis task description
   - Applies to both default workflow and summary workflow
   - Expected output updated to reflect TLDR requirement

2. **Updated `improved_synthesis.py`**:
   - Added TLDR as critical requirement (#2 in synthesis instructions)
   - Positioned before detailed multi-dimensional understanding
   - Clear formatting guidelines for TLDR section

### TLDR Format

The TLDR section includes:
- **Main Point**: The core argument, discovery, or message in one sentence
- **Key Insights**: 2-3 important findings or takeaways
- **Implication**: The primary "so what?" factor or takeaway

Example structure:
```
TLDR:
- Main discovery: Researchers found that X leads to Y through Z mechanism
- Key finding 1: The effect is 3x stronger than previously thought
- Key finding 2: This works across all tested populations
- Implication: This could revolutionize how we approach problem A
```

## Benefits

1. **Quick Overview**: Readers can immediately grasp the essence of long documents
2. **Better Navigation**: Helps decide if the full synthesis is worth reading
3. **Memory Aid**: Easy to remember key points
4. **Shareability**: TLDR can be extracted for quick communication
5. **Processing Efficiency**: Agents working with synthesis can quickly understand context

## Usage

### For Users
- The TLDR appears automatically at the beginning of every synthesis
- No additional flags or options needed
- Works with all workflows (default, summary, improved synthesis)

### For Developers
- TLDR is part of the synthesis output, not the final educational script
- Educational writers should process the TLDR content, not include it verbatim
- Can be extracted programmatically by searching for "TLDR:" marker

## Technical Details

### Synthesis Task Prompt Addition
```python
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - START WITH A TLDR:
Begin your synthesis with a "TLDR:" section (3-5 bullet points) that captures:
- The main argument or discovery in one sentence
- 2-3 key findings or insights
- The primary implication or takeaway
```

### Expected Format
- Starts with "TLDR:" on its own line
- Followed by 3-5 bullet points
- Each bullet point is concise and impactful
- Separated from main synthesis by blank line

## Testing

Use `test_tldr_synthesis.py` to verify:
1. TLDR is present in synthesis output
2. TLDR contains appropriate number of bullet points
3. TLDR is properly formatted
4. TLDR doesn't appear in final educational scripts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Language-specific TLDR formatting (e.g., "Resumen Ejecutivo" for Spanish)
2. Configurable TLDR length based on document size
3. TLDR extraction API for quick summaries
4. TLDR-only mode for rapid document scanning
