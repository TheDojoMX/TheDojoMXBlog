    # Scale in AI: The Defining Feature of Modern AI
    
    If I could use only one word to describe AI post-2020, it would be scale. The AI models
    behind applications like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Midjourney are at such a
    scale that they're consuming a nontrivial portion of the world's electricity.
    
    ## The Scaling Consequences
    
    The scaling up of AI models has two major consequences:
    
    1. AI models are becoming more powerful and capable of more tasks
    2. Training requires resources that only a few organizations can afford
    
    This has led to the emergence of "model as a service" - models developed by few 
    organizations are made available for others to use as a service.
    
    ## Foundation Models
    
    Foundation models emerged from large language models. They use self-supervision
    to grow to unprecedented scale. A language model encodes statistical information
    about languages, telling us how likely a word is to appear in a given context.
    
    ## Applications
    
    Modern AI enables applications like:
    - ChatGPT for conversational AI
    - GitHub Copilot for code generation  
    - Midjourney for image generation
    
    These represent the culmination of decades of technology advancement.
