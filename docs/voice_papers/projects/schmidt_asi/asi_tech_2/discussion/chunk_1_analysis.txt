• Digital super intelligence is expected within 10 years. 
• AI’s ability to generate its own scaffolding is predicted to be available by 2025. 
• Digital super intelligence is described as providing an equivalent of having a polymath (the combined capabilities of figures such as Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci) in one’s pocket. 
• In network effect businesses, when a learning machine learns faster, performance accelerates toward a natural limit defined by available electricity rather than chip performance. 
• Meta has signed a 20-year nuclear contract with Constellation Energy. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are also investing in nuclear capacity. 
• The current expected additional power needed for the AI revolution in the United States is 92 gigawatts (GW), with 1 GW approximately equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power station. 
• Only two nuclear power plants have been built in the past 30 years. 
• A small modular reactor (SMR) with a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) is expected to be available starting in 2030. 
• Data centers, as approximations of digital brains working in concert (a “superbrain”), may require on the order of 1 GW capacity per data center and need hundreds of thousands of chips. 
• The economics of data center infrastructure indicate that to support a capital expenditure of $50 billion depreciated over 3–4 years, an annual capital spend of approximately $10 to $15 billion is required. 
• Many startups are developing non-traditional chip designs and variants of the transformer architecture optimized for inference time computing. 
• Examples mentioned include developments such as the Blackwell chip and AMD’s 350 chip, which are described as massive supercomputers used as part of data center infrastructure. 
• An example from AI research is provided with open oi03, which utilizes forward and backward reinforcement learning and planning; the computational cost for planning is many orders of magnitude higher compared to simple query answering. 
• The discussion includes observations that, with improved energy supply and technology, evidence of planning can be shown, and the combination of planning with deep memory could potentially lead to human-level intelligence. 
• Additional context on technical trends is provided, with mention of areas such as humanoid robots, AGI, quantum computing, transport, energy, and longevity, which are tracked as major technological meta trends.
