==================================================
• Digital super intelligence is defined as a system that, when generally available and safe, offers the equivalent of having a polymath (for example, the combined capabilities of Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci) in one’s pocket.
• It is predicted that digital super intelligence will arrive within 10 years.
• Self-referential learning in AI is expected to progress so quickly that performance could become 1,000×, 1,000,000×, or even 1,000,000,000× more capable than that of a human.
• The capability increase is driven by an acceleration where a learning machine improving its own processes reaches performance limits determined by non-chip factors.
• Concerns include that as digital systems automate tasks (e.g., asking a robot or an AI to perform an action), there is a risk of diminishing human agency and human purpose.
