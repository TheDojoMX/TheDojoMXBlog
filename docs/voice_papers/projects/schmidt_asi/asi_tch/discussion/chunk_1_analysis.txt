==================================================
• Digital super intelligence is expected within 10 years. 
• AI will soon have the ability to generate its own scaffolding, projected around 2025.
• The concept includes having an equivalent of a polymath, combining the intellectual capacity of figures such as Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci.
• Meta has signed a 20-year nuclear contract with Constellation Energy. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are also acquiring nuclear capacity.
• An expected additional power requirement for the AI revolution in the United States is 92 gigawatts. One gigawatt is equivalent to the output of a large nuclear power station.
• In the past 30 years, only two nuclear power plants have been built.
• A small modular reactor (SMR) is planned to provide 300 megawatts, with operation beginning in 2030.
• The transformer architecture powering current AI systems is receiving new variants optimized for inference, with startups focusing on developing simpler inference time computing.
• Examples of high-performance chips include the Blackwell chip and AMD’s 350 chip, which are described as massive supercomputers. Hundreds of thousands of these chips are needed to operate a data center.
• Advances in AI include progress from language processing to reasoning through techniques such as forward and back reinforcement learning and planning. The computational cost for these planning operations is several orders of magnitude higher than for simple question answering.
• The integration of planning with deep memories is being explored as a pathway to achieving human-level intelligence.
• There is a trend toward investment in non-traditional chip designs aimed at significantly increasing energy efficiency.
• Data centers, with capacities such as 1 gigawatt, are considered crucial in the context of digital brain or “superbrain” capabilities.
• The overall discussion compares traditional energy generation from countries (such as the United States, Canada, and parts of the Western world) with China’s abundant electricity resources, emphasizing a competitive race in chip and energy scalability.
