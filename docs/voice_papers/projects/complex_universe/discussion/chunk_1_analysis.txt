The section begins with the presentation of a bold new idea: that complexity increases over time not only in living organisms but universally, including nonliving systems. The article uses the famous Fermi paradox—the question of why alien civilizations have not been observed despite the vast time available for them to emerge—to introduce the counterintuitive possibility that intelligent life might be much more widespread than previously thought. This possibility is anchored in a proposed “law of nature” that suggests complexity increases inexorably over time, in a way that is comparable to the second law of thermodynamics (which mandates an increase in entropy). In this view, biological evolution is only one manifestation of a broader principle that selects systems rich in “functional information” or the capacity to perform functions.

Key evidence and reasoning in the section include a historical context: in 1950, Enrico Fermi mused about the absence of intelligent extraterrestrial life, leading to many possible explanations. Rather than simply attributing this absence to the rarity or self-destruction of intelligent life, a group of researchers—led by mineralogist Robert Hazen and astrobiologist Michael Wong—argue that evolution (whether in life forms or other complex systems) is governed by a universal principle. Their work suggests that as systems evolve, they accumulate functional information—that is, information that contributes directly to the performance of specific tasks. This notion transforms evolution from a purely biological process into a general physical principle that could apply to all forms of matter.

A significant part of the argument is built on the concept of “functional information,” first proposed by biologist Jack Szostak in 2003. Szostak recognized that traditional measures of information (such as those developed by Claude Shannon or Andrey Kolmogorov) do not account for how biological molecules function. By focusing on molecular function—using, for example, RNA aptamers' ability to bind a specific target—the concept distinguishes between sequences that merely appear complex and those that are complex in a way that matters for specific tasks. Experimental evidence showed that as RNA aptamers were evolved in the lab toward increased binding performance, their “functional information” approached a theoretical maximum. This observation directly ties the notion of function to a quantifiable measure of complexity.

The narrative then bridges to the work of Hazen, who, intrigued by origins-of-life questions, recognized that the divide between living and nonliving might be artificial. By combining ideas with Szostak and later with Wong (who joined the team with a background in planetary atmospheres), Hazen’s research sought to demonstrate a continuum from simple chemical reactions up to living systems, all governed by an increasing accumulation of functional information. Through computer simulations and experimental collaborations, they found that complexity can indeed increase spontaneously over time, independent of the specifics of chemistry. Their work challenges traditional predictive limits of Darwinian evolution by suggesting that embedding evolution in this broader law might provide insights into what future complexity may look like.

Nevertheless, the proposal is not without controversy. Critics argue that extending the concept of evolution—and particularly the measurable component of functional information—to non-living systems may be overreaching. They highlight that the method to quantify functional information is context-dependent and can be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate in a universal sense, rendering the theory nearly untestable by conventional scientific standards. This debate touches on deeper issues regarding whether the basic laws of physics can wholly account for the emergence of function and novelty in the universe.

In technical and conceptual terms, the section lays the groundwork for a paradigm where the increase in complexity (or informational content that directly results in function) is treated as a fundamental aspect of natural law. It underscores the idea that traditional boundaries between living and nonliving might blur when viewed through the lens of evolving systems that accumulate complexity over time. The discussion of experiments with RNA aptamers, computer simulations of evolving algorithms, and the theoretical framing of functional information provides concrete examples while also inviting broader philosophical and scientific debates about the nature of evolution.

Overall, this section sets up a narrative that is both scientifically innovative and philosophically provocative. It reframes evolutionary theory as a subset of a more global, perhaps even inevitable, progression toward increasing complexity—a narrative that could have far-reaching implications for our understanding not only of life on Earth but of the universe as a whole. The arguments, evidence, and technical details laid out here are intended to open up new ways of thinking about phenomena ranging from molecular biology to cosmology, while also acknowledging the intellectual contest and uncertainty that naturally accompany such a transformative idea.
