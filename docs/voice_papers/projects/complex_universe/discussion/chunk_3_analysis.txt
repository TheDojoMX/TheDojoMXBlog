In this section, the discussion begins by drawing an analogy to Gödel’s incompleteness theorem in mathematics, emphasizing that a formal system always permits statements that cannot be definitively proven true or false without new axioms. This insight is then extended to biological evolution. Davies and colleagues argue that evolution is “open‐ended” because it is self‐referential: once new components appear in an evolving system, they modify the “phase space” by feeding back into the system and creating entirely new possibilities—a dynamic not seen in most physical systems (for example, although a galaxy contains millions of stars, it lacks this self-referential feature).

A key finding is the idea that an increase in complexity is not just a passive accumulation of parts but rather a process that unlocks new strategies and functionalities. Marcus Heisler, a plant developmental biologist, is quoted noting that the added complexity affords opportunities for new strategies that simpler organisms cannot access. Davies connects this emergent complexity and associated noncomputability directly to what he calls “the magic” of life.

The section further explores the idea that when complex cognition enters the process (where components of a system can reason, choose, and experiment “in their heads”), the potential for feedback and open-ended evolution is magnified. Hazen is cited comparing technological evolution to biological evolution: a watch is produced faster when the maker is not blind, suggesting that cognitive processes and purpose can accelerate the rise of complexity. 

This raises the provocative implication that if evolution involving selection inherently increases “functional information” (a measure of complexity tied to the ability to perform functions), then life—and even consciousness or higher intelligence—might be inevitable in the universe. This counters earlier views (such as Ernst Mayr’s argument against the likelihood of humanlike intelligence) by suggesting that once the threshold of life is crossed, an ever-accelerating increase in complexity occurs, regardless of highly improbable events.

Importantly, there is also a suggestion that as complexity increases, new “causal laws” may emerge that, while remaining compatible with the underlying physical laws, come to dominate the evolutionary trajectory of a system. An illustrative example is given by comparing Galileo’s classical experiment—predicting the path of falling masses—with how that prediction breaks down for dynamic and complex entities such as living birds. 

The section then introduces assembly theory as an alternative approach to describe the evolution of complexity. In partnership with Lee Cronin and Sara Walker, the idea of an “assembly index” is presented. This index measures the minimum number of steps needed to build an object from its basic ingredients, providing a way to quantify complex structure in a manner analogous to but distinct from traditional measures of “functional information.” Walker reasons that while living systems might eventually be governed by distinct laws from those in classical physics, such laws do exist—but she also voices skepticism about the practical possibility of rigorously testing the “law of functional information,” given its inherent challenges in metrology.

Hazen acknowledges that quantifying functional information is difficult—even for complex systems like a single living cell—yet he maintains that a conceptual understanding coupled with approximations is sufficient much as we navigate the gravitational complexities of the asteroid belt without exact solutions. 

The text then shifts to potential applications of these ideas in astrobiology and beyond. For example, the restricted repertoire of organic molecules in living organisms (as a result of selection processes) may serve as a biosignature for detecting life elsewhere in the universe. Assembly theory similarly suggests that complexity-based biosignatures could be used to identify life forms on other worlds. Additionally, Hazen’s team is engaging with experts across disciplines—from economists to neuroscientists—who see potential in applying these concepts to diverse fields such as oncology, soil science, and even language evolution. An example is provided where the evolution of cancer cells is compared to the selective pressures in evolution, though operating under different criteria than classic Darwinian fitness.

Underlying these discussions is a unifying, albeit challenging, idea: evolution might be seen not merely as a biological process, but as a universal trend toward increasing functional information—akin in its inevitability and directionality to the second law of thermodynamics. This perspective blurs the traditional boundaries between living and nonliving matter, suggesting that evolution, function, and complexity are intertwined in ways that could ultimately reshape our understanding of the cosmos. 

The section is both scientifically innovative and philosophically provocative. Its reasoning hinges on connecting mathematical ideas of incompleteness and self-reference with biological evolution and even extends to cosmic processes. While critics remain concerned about the challenge of quantifying functional information in nonliving systems and the speculative nature of such a universal law, the framework invites a profound reassessment of our understanding of evolution and the forces that shape the universe. The possibility that new, emergent laws might take over at higher levels of complexity—much as the rise of human intelligence transformed our earthly milieu—opens up a spectrum of exciting, interdisciplinary research questions.
