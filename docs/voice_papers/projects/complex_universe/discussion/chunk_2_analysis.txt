==================================================
The section under analysis introduces a novel way of thinking about complexity by suggesting that the evolution of systems – whether living organisms, minerals, or even the chemical elements – is driven by an accumulation of "functional information." This idea challenges the conventional notion that evolution is exclusive to biology and instead proposes that nature, in general, selects for arrangements that can perform functions. The central insight is that evolution is not only a matter of random assembly followed by natural selection; rather, as systems evolve, they gradually access new “levels” or “floors” of complexity, each characterized by a new set of selective criteria.

The authors describe how researchers like Robert Hazen and Michael Wong realized that approaching the question of complexity required interdisciplinary expertise. They note that the problem is not just about mineralogy or physics alone but involves a confluence of disciplines. This interdisciplinary approach led to the recognition that “functional information” might be universal—a form of information parallel in importance to mass, charge, or energy. Functional information, as discussed here, is essentially the selective advantage certain combinations have over less-fit compositions in a given environmental context. For example, even among the vast number of minerals that could theoretically form from available elements, only a few are observed because conditions favor the more stable or “functionally” appropriate arrangements.

One key argument is that the arrow of complexity – much like the arrow of time granted by the second law of thermodynamics – may be driven by selective processes that favor function. Hazen remarks that while the second law supplies a direction of time via entropy, the trajectory of increasing complexity seems to be guided by selection for function, an “orderly process” which, although not inconsistent with thermodynamics, leads to states of higher functional information. This view is bolstered with evidence gathered from both mineral evolution and experiments with artificial-life algorithms. For instance, researchers noted that functional information in systems like RNA aptamers increases, sometimes in abrupt jumps, echoing biological events such as the emergence of the cellular nucleus, the Cambrian explosion, and even the rise of human intelligence.

In parallel, the work extends beyond the biological realm into the geometry of chemical elements. The narrative traces the cosmic evolution from the simple, early state characterized by hydrogen, helium, and lithium – to the formation of heavier, more complex elements in stellar environments. Here, the increase in nuclear complexity is seen as analogous to the gradual (or occasionally punctuated) accumulation of functional information observed in both living systems and nonliving matter.

The section elaborates further on the idea that evolution is not deterministic in the traditional sense. Quoted thinkers such as Kauffman argue that evolution constantly unlocks new possibilities—functions that could not have been predicted or even conceived in previous evolutionary stages. This idea is encapsulated in the statement that “the biosphere is creating its own possibilities,” indicating that the repertoire of potential functions is not fixed but is dynamically expanding. As the system evolves, criteria for successful selection change, a process metaphorically described as moving to a “next floor up” where entirely unanticipated possibilities emerge. This concept ties back to mathematical ideas such as Gödel’s incompleteness theorems: Just as mathematical axiomatic systems always leave open statements that require new axioms, the evolving world continually expands its own phase space, leading to novel forms and functions that defy deterministic prediction.

Furthermore, the article hints at universal implications. If functional information drives complexity in both living and nonliving systems, then this might indicate a universal law of complexity analogous to the second law of thermodynamics. Such a perspective would merge our understanding of biological evolution with fundamental physical principles. However, it is acknowledged that this leap is not without controversy. Critics argue that quantifying functional information in a universal context is challenging because it is inherently contextual – what counts as “functional” depends on the specific task and environment. They contend that while the framework is provocative, its application beyond biology risks being speculative and hard to test by conventional scientific methods.

To summarize the key technical and conceptual details:
• The researchers’ interdisciplinary approach allowed them to see that evolution is not confined to biology but might be a universal process marked by the accumulation of functional information.
• The concept of functional information redefines complexity, emphasizing selective processes that favor specific, functionally effective states—observable in minerals as well as in biomolecules.
• Evidence includes computer simulations and experimental evolution (e.g., RNA aptamer evolution), which show abrupt jumps in complexity analogous to phase transitions in physics.
• The framework connects to deep philosophical and scientific debates, suggesting that even the laws governing matter and energy might be complemented by a law that governs the increase in functional information.
• There is an acknowledgment of controversy: the idea of extending functional information to nonliving systems necessarily challenges traditional boundaries between biology and physics, making the proposal both revolutionary and subject to critical debate.

Overall, this section is significant because it reorients our understanding of evolution from a biological process to a universal trend, suggesting that the universe itself is driven by evolving functional information. This perspective not only unifies diverse phenomena—from mineral formation to cellular life—but also pushes us to consider how new functions arise unpredictably, setting the stage for continual, foundational shifts in complexity. Such a paradigm invites a profound reevaluation of the nature of evolution and hints at exciting new directions in understanding the cosmos.
