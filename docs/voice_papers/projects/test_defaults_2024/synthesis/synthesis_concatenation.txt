TLDR:
• Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini represent a major breakthrough in artificial intelligence.
• They demonstrate advanced capabilities including natural language understanding, text generation, code generation, debugging, mathematical reasoning, and creative writing.
• LLMs are trained using transformer architecture with strategies like pre-training, fine-tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and are applied in fields such as chatbots, coding assistants, content generation, and education.
