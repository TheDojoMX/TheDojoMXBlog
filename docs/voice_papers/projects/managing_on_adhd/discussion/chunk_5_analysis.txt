HD, to use high neuroticism to defeat low conscientiousness. There s an element of truth to that, sure (see mastery of drudgery).
But here s the thing: you have to play to your strengths. You have to. If you are very OCD and you like order and systems and planning but you struggle with doing, then, yeah, it might work, for you, to spend more energy on the trappings of productivity (ensuring your todo list is properly formatted, organized, etc.) if that bleeds over into making it easier to do the real, meaningful things.
For example: I like emojis in my todo list. The chores have an emoji, the comms tasks have an emoji. That kind of thing. Makes it easy to see at a glance what kind of things I have to do, to group them by category. But Todoist doesn t support emoji icons on tasks, unlike Notion, so adding the emojis takes a bit more effort: I have to open Raycast and search for the emoji I want and paste it into the task title. It adds a little friction each time I create a task, but the benefit is I enjoy using the todo list more.
The Master of Drudgery
Avoid spending too much productive time on worthless chores.
A productivity antipattern: indulging too much in quick wins.
There s this running joke, or meme, online, about the kind of person who has this huge, colossal productivity system, but they get nothing done. They have five todo list apps and everything is categorized and indexed and sorted, but their material output is zero. They complete a hundred tasks a day and when you interrogate what those tasks are they are brush my teeth or reorganize my bookshelf. There s a lot of truth to that.
Every task falls into one of two categories: the quick wins, and everything else. Life is not made of quick wins. Creative, generative, open-ended work requires long periods of focused work. A lot of unpleasant, aversion-causing things have to be done. But the quick wins are infinite: there s always some micro-chore to do around the house, for example.
I don t have advice specifically on avoiding this. But you should notice if you re doing it and course-correct.
Thrashing
Don t let procrastination on one task derail everything else.
A bad failure mode I have is: I have a task T that I have to do, but I can t, because of some kind of aversion. But when I try to work on other things, the alarms are going off in my head, telling me to work on T because you ve been putting this off for so long and life is finite and the years are short and all that. The end result is that because one thing is blocked, everything grinds to a halt. It s a very annoying state to be in.
And I don t have a perfect solution, but I try to manage it but applying a sense of proportionality, render unto Caesar etc. You can t ignore T forever, dually, you probably won t solve it in the next ten minutes. But you can timebox T: allocate some block of time every day to try to advance it, or at least to work around it, e. g. to ask a friend for help, for example. And the rest of the day you can dedicate to moving other things forward.
Put Travel in the Calendar
Calculate travel time ahead of time to avoid being late.
I am chronically late. So if I have a calendar event like a party at someone s home, I will go on Google Maps and measure the travel time (from my home or wherever I m likely to be) to the destination, and make a time block for that. e. g., if it takes 30m to go to the dentist and back, this is what my calendar looks like:
This ensures I leave my home on time. If it s something especially important I often add 15m to the travel block as a buffer.
Use tools that are effective and you like.
What productivity app should I use? Reminders? Linear? Todoist? A bullet journal?
Use something that feels good and works. That s all. Personally I use Todoist. A lot of people think todo list apps are commodities, but when you have an app open for 98% of your screentime, the little subtleties really add up. I ve tried using Reminders, Linear, as my todo lists, and building my own. My productivity always suffers and I always go back to Todoist.
One app is better than two: the more disjoint things you have to pay attention to, the worse it is.
If you re a software engineer I strongly advise against building your own, which is a terrible form of procrastination for creative types.
Resources
How To Do Things describes an ADHD-friendly version of the Pomodoro method. It s a 50 page PDF with no fluff, so it s worth buying to support writers who don t waste the reader s time.
Getting Things Done has a lot of good advice (e. g. dump your entire brain into the todo list) but it s somewhat neurotypical in that it s assumed you won t have any problems actually executing the tasks.
