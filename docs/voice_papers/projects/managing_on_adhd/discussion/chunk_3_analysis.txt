number of them, and the uncertainty factor, makes the sum seem a lot larger. A classic example for me is having to reply to like ten different people. Realistically, each person can be handled in 15s. One or two might require a couple of minutes to compose a longer reply. But often I will avoid those tasks like the plague and drag them across the entire day. The pomodoro method works here because you’re basically trading (up to) 25m of pain for an entire day’s peace and quiet. So you get all the annoying little tasks together, start a timer, and go through them. And usually you’re done in maybe ten minutes. And you feel really good after, because all those annoying little tasks are done. It really is amazing what a little bit of fake urgency can do.

Starting: sometimes the problem is just starting. It is very trite, but it’s true. You have something you want to want to do, but don’t want to do. I want to want to read this book, to learn this topic, to write this blog post, to work on this software project. But I don’t want to do it. The pomodoro method helps you start. You’re not committing to finishing the project. You’re not committing to months or weeks or days or even hours of work. You’re committing to a half hour. And if you work just that half hour: great, promise kept. 30m a day, over the course of a single month, is 15h of work. And often I start a 30m timer and end up working four hours, and maybe that’s a good outcome.

Stopping: dually, sometimes the problem is stopping. If you’re trying to advance multiple projects at the same time, if you hyperfocus on one, it eats into the time you allocated for the others. And more broadly, spending too much time on one project can derail all your plans for the day. Maybe you meant to go to the gym at 6pm but you got so stuck in with this project that it’s 8:30pm and you’re still glued to the screen. So the gym suffers, your sleep schedule suffers, etc. Actually stopping when the pomodoro timer goes off can prevent excessive single-mindedness. Additionally, the five-minute break at the end of the pomodoro block is useful. It’s a time to get up from the computer, unround your shoulders, practice mindfulness, essentially, all those little things that you want to do a few times throughout the day.

Tactics
Stratagems, tricks.

Task Selection
To select the next task, pick either the shortest or the most-procrastinated task.
I don’t like the word prioritize, because it has two subtly different meanings:
• Weak prioritization means to sort a list of tasks by some unspecified criterion, that is, to establish an order where some things are prior to another.
• Strong prioritization is to sort a list specifically by importance.
Weak prioritization is something everyone should do: it takes a moment to go over the todo list and drag the tasks into more or less the order in which you will do them. This keeps the most relevant tasks near the top, which is where your eyes naturally go to.
Strong prioritization is a terrible job scheduling algorithm. Importance alone is not good enough.
Consider the case where you have a very important task A which takes a long time to finish, and a less important task B which takes 5m to finish. For example, writing an essay versus replying to an email. Which should you do first? I would execute B first, because doing so in turn unblocks B’s successor tasks. If you reply to the email and then get to work on task A, the other person has time to read your email and reply to you. And the conversation moves forward while you are otherwise engaged.
Of course, the pathological version of this is where you only action the quick wins: all the minute little chores get done instantly, but the big tasks, requiring long periods of concentration, get postponed perpetually.
My task-selection algorithm is basically: do the shortest task first, with two exceptions:
– Stalled tasks get a priority bump. If I created a task weeks ago, or if I’ve been postponing it for many days in a row, it has to be done now.
– Content-dependence: if I’m working on a particular project, I’d rather focus on tasks from that project, rather than from the global todo list.

Visual Field Management
To remember something, put it in your visual field. Dually: to forget, get it out of sight.
Out of sight, out of mind. The corollary: to keep something in mind, put it in your visual field; to keep it out, leave it out.
My desk is very spartan: there’s a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, and a few trinkets. My desktop is empty. There are no files in it. The dock has only the apps I use frequently. And at a higher level, I try to keep the apartment very clean and orderly. Because everything that’s out of place is a distraction, visual noise. That’s the negative aspect: the things I remove.
The positive aspect, the things I keep in my visual field: most of the time, I have two windows open on my computer – the todo list occupies the left third of the screen, the right two-thirds are occupied by whatever window I have open at the time, e.g.:
And so at a glance, I can see:
• What I’m currently working on.
• What I will work on next.
• The list of active projects, so that I don’t forget they exist.

Project Check-Ins
Keep in regular contact with long-running projects.
A common failure mode I have is, I will fail to finish a project because I forget I even started it. Or, relatedly: I will let a project drag on and on until enough time has passed that my interests have shifted, the sun has set on it, and it is now a slog to finish.
One reason I do this is that creative/intellectual work often requires (or feels like it requires) long stretches of uninterrupted time. So I procrastinate working on something until I can find such a chunk of time. Which never comes. Time passes and the project begins to slip the moorings of my attention, as other new and shiny things arrive.
And sometimes I will pick the project back up after months or years, and I have lost so much context, it’s impossible to know what I even intended. And then you procrastinate even more, because you don’t want to feel the guilt of picking up a project and realizing it has become strange and unfamiliar to you.
One way to combat this is to make regular project checkins. This could be a daily or few-times-a-week recurring task on Todoist that just says spend 30m on this project.
You don’t even have to work on the thing: just allocate fifteen minutes to hold the project in your mind and nothing else. If it’s creative writing, you might open the Word document and just look at it. If it’s a programming project: read the Jira board and look at the code again. Don’t write anything. Just read.
You will likely come up with a few tasks to do, so write those down. Think. Plan. Build up the structures in your mind, refresh the caches. If you can do, do; otherwise, plan, and if you can’t even do that, read.
When you’re doing this regularly, when you’re in regular contact with the project, when the shape of it is clear in your mind, you will have the tasks on the top of your mind, you will no longer feel that you need a giant empty runway of time to work on it, you will be able to work on it in shorter chunks.
To manage long-term creative work, keep in regular contact. That doesn’t mean work on them every day, but maybe look at them every day.
The pomodoro method works here. Set a timer for just 25m to keep in touch with the project.

Centralize Your Inboxes
Bring all tasks, broadly defined, into one todo list.
Life is full of inboxes:
• Email
• DMs on Twitter
• iMessage
• WhatsApp
• Signal
• Discord, etc.
• Twitter bookmarks
• Browser bookmarks
• Your Downloads folder.
• Messages in my myGov inbox.
• The physical mailbox in my apartment.
These are inboxes because they fill up over time and need action to empty. You can also think of them as little domain-specific task lists. Centralizing your inboxes means moving all these tasks from their silos into the one, central todo list.
For example, I have a daily task called catch up to clear the digital inboxes:
Go through all my communication apps (email, Discord, Twitter DMs etc.) and triage the unread conversations: if something needs replying to, I either reply immediately or make a task to reply later so I don’t forget. File the contents of my Downloads folder. Go through Twitter/browser bookmarks and turn them into tasks (e.g., if I bookmark an article, the task is to read the article).
In this way I mostly manage to stay on top of comms.

Inbox Zero
All inboxes should be at zero.
You have probably heard of inbox zero. It sounds like LinkedIn-tier advice. But if you struggle with comms, with replying to people in a timely manner (or at all), inbox zero is a good strategy. There are two reasons, briefly:
• Inbox zero has no false negatives: if an inbox is empty, you know you’ve handled everything.
• Important communications have a way of camouflaging themselves among irrelevance.
And, like everything: before you make it into a habit, it feels incredibly time-consuming and labour-intensive. But once you make it into a habit, it’s almost effortless.
So, I will give you an example. I come in to work, and read four emails. Three could’ve been archived outright, one needed a reply from me. And I said, oh, I’ll get to it in a second. And then I got distracted with other tasks. And throughout the day I kept glancing at the email client, and thinking, yeah, I will get to it. Eventually I got used to those four emails: they are the new normal, and what’s normal doesn’t require action. I would think: if those emails are there, and I already looked at them, then it’s probably fine. At the end of the day I looked at the inbox again and saw, wait, no, one of those emails was actually important. That’s the failure mode of inbox greater-than-zero: the important stuff hides among the irrelevant stuff, such that a quick glance at the todo list doesn’t show anything obviously wrong.

Comprehensive Analysis and Insights:

1. Key Findings, Insights, and Arguments:
   • The section begins with addressing the paralyzing effect of numerous small tasks. The author explains how the perceived enormity of a task list—amplified by uncertainty—can be mitigated by the Pomodoro method. By creating “fake urgency” (a fixed, short time block), one can bundle and complete these micro-tasks efficiently.
   • There is a dual focus on both “starting” and “stopping” tasks. The difficulty of simply beginning a task is countered by committing to a limited period (e.g., a half-hour), which often leads to an unexpectedly productive session. Conversely, the danger of hyperfocus is recognized with the advice to stop after a designated timer goes off, thereby preventing one task from monopolizing the day.

2. Important Data, Statistics, or Evidence:
   • The author provides practical estimates, for example, handling each email reply might take only 15 seconds, yet procrastination magnifies the perceived load.
   • A 30-minute work period, sustained daily, cumulates to 15 hours per month—and sometimes a short burst extends into several hours, demonstrating the nonlinear payoff when one can overcome the inertia of beginning.

3. Novel Concepts or Frameworks Introduced:
   • The idea of “trading 25 minutes of pain for an entire day’s peace and quiet” encapsulates a strategic use of time that reframes short bursts of effort as worthwhile investments.
   • The section introduces a two-tiered task selection algorithm that favors the shortest or most procrastinated task. Importantly, it distinguishes between “weak prioritization” (a basic rearrangement of tasks) and “strong prioritization” (which might lead to deadlock by focusing only on importance). This innovative framework challenges conventional prioritization methods by emphasizing the unblockage of subsequent dependencies.

4. Connections to Other Parts:
   • Although Section 3 is rooted in concrete task management tactics, it echoes themes introduced earlier in the paper regarding ADHD’s interplay between internal biological factors and external system supports. The methods described here (such as Pomodoro, visual field management, and centralized inboxes) dovetail with broader strategies for cognitive scaffolding discussed in other sections.
   • There is a consistent narrative about reducing visual and cognitive clutter—linking the idea of a spartan workspace with the externalization of memory tasks through digital tools—underscoring the overall integrative approach of the paper.

5. Implications and Significance:
   • The techniques described are significant because they empower individuals with ADHD to overcome both inertia and hyperfocus. By systematically addressing the twin challenges of starting and stopping, the author offers actionable steps that enhance productivity.
   • Centralizing one’s task ecosystem (through a unified todo list) and maintaining an “inbox zero” introduces a robust external memory system that is critical for managing distractions and ensuring that no task is inadvertently neglected.
   • Overall, these strategies facilitate an environment where even small, seemingly insignificant tasks are methodically handled, reducing cognitive load and liberating mental energy for more demanding projects.

6. Controversies or Debates:
   • The discussion on prioritization critiques the conventional emphasis on task importance. The author’s preference for handling the “quick wins” before the big, important tasks challenges prevailing productivity wisdom and could raise debate among those who value traditional hierarchical planning.
   • Additionally, the reliance on methods like the Pomodoro technique might be seen as oversimplifying the complex dynamics of ADHD, though the narrative is clear that these methods are tools to trigger momentum rather than panaceas.

7. Technical Details That Matter:
   • The mechanics of the Pomodoro method are described with precise timing (25-minute work blocks, 5-minute breaks) and are adapted to not only spur initiation but also to enforce stopping to prevent hyperfocus.
   • Task selection nuances include a preference for the shortest tasks first with accommodations for “stalled tasks” (those postponed for too long) and content-dependence when working within a specific project domain.
   • The concept of visual field management is both a physical and psychological tactic: keeping only essential items in view to avoid distractions and ensure that active projects remain top of mind.
   • The integration of various digital communication and task environments (email, messaging apps, browser bookmarks, etc.) into one centralized todo list is a critical strategy for maintaining clarity and avoiding the “inbox greater-than-zero” pitfall.

In summary, Section 3 of “Notes on Managing ADHD” offers a practical, multifaceted approach designed to navigate the complexities of task management faced by individuals with ADHD. It blends concrete techniques (using time blocks, strategic task selection, and visual field management) with a deep understanding of the cognitive pitfalls inherent in ADHD. By outlining how to both initiate and terminate work sessions prudently, centralize scattered inputs, and maintain ongoing contact with long-running projects, the section provides a comprehensive toolkit. These insights not only bridge the gap between internal cognitive challenges and external organizational methods but also underscore the broader philosophy of transforming small, methodical actions into tangible, cumulative productivity gains. This systemic and highly detailed approach is at the heart of the paper’s aim to integrate practical strategies with an understanding of the ADHD mind, offering actionable solutions that are both scalable and sustainable.
