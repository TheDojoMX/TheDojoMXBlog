The section begins with a literary quotation from Jorge Luis Borges, setting a reflective tone that contrasts with the straightforward practicalities of managing ADHD. The narrative immediately anchors the discussion in a dual-layered approach: managing ADHD requires both high-level strategies (control systems and internal changes) and micro-level tactics (implementing subtle “trick” strategies) that interact to form a coherent whole.

The author underscores that ADHD has a strictly biological underpinning, emphasizing that drugs—specifically stimulants—form the “first-line treatment.” This is not social commentary but a technical assertion: the biological nature of ADHD mandates a reliance on medication to unlock further self-management strategies that might otherwise be ineffective if one relies solely on willpower. The text explains that many auxiliary strategies (for example, using a todo list or pomodoro timers) only become accessible and functional once the stimulant medications have adjusted the brain chemistry. Thus, medication is portrayed both as a primary treatment and as a facilitator that makes the implementation of additional habits viable.

A key example is provided with the discussion of melatonin. The author explains the evolution from a failed effort to regulate sleep hygiene via strict discipline to a simpler, more immediate solution: taking a pill at a predetermined time. The alarm is not meant to serve as a strict behavioral command but rather as a gentle nudge, a minimal effort that leads to a change in preference—a shift in the internal “cost-benefit” analysis of the individual. This example deepens the discussion on how chemical interventions can override dysfunctional habits and establish new patterns without relying on potentially unreliable willpower.

In developing the deeper framework of personal growth and ADHD management, the author differentiates between internal and external changes. Internal changes include medication, meditation, therapy, or long-term habit formation; external changes refer to the practical systems and structures one sets up, such as using a todo list, calendars, or clearing one’s workspace to avoid distractions. The interplay between these two realms is depicted as a back-and-forth ladder: medication (an internal change) initially unlocks the capacity to use an external tool (the todo list), which then scaffolds the creation of habits that, in turn, foster further internal improvements. This dynamic progression emphasizes that neither internal nor external modifications are sufficient in isolation—they must work in tandem.

The paper then moves onto a very detailed explanation of using a todo list as a neuroprosthesis, highlighting its fundamental role in compensating for deficits in long-term memory and task management. The list isn’t just an app; it is portrayed as an extension of cognitive function. The todo list's three principal functions are explained: memory (to remember all tasks, ensuring nothing is forgotten), order (to allow for re-prioritization and flexible planning), and hierarchy (to break down tasks into increasingly manageable subtasks). The author supports this by recounting personal experiences: how a forgotten commitment, such as reading progress, or the struggle to maintain routine habits can be effectively mitigated by systematizing tasks in one’s digital assistant.

Furthermore, details are provided about the specific structure the author uses in Todoist: various projects and lists (Tasks, Groceries, Ideas, Blog, Reading List, Cycles, Projects) serve distinct roles in managing different aspects of life. This highly organized structure is not arbitrary but a deliberate method to ensure even the most subtle tasks are captured and acted upon—ultimately preventing the “out of sight, out of mind” trap that often undermines project completion.

Another significant technical detail involves the discussion around mental energy. Here, the common metaphor of “spoon theory” is contrasted with the author’s preferred analogy of voltage. Instead of a fungible resource that steadily depletes (like spoons), mental energy is framed as a threshold phenomenon where certain tasks require a minimum “voltage” to be initiated. High-voltage tasks (such as emotionally charged or creative work) require a higher threshold that declines over the day, while low-voltage chores are less demanding. This analogy serves to better articulate why scheduling and the timing of tasks are crucial for people with ADHD, as the capacity to “switch on” to a given task can be highly variable based on the time of day.

The reasoning throughout this section is tightly interwoven with the evidence provided by the author’s personal experiences—from struggling with sleep hygiene to systematically building habits via a todo list—and the practical implementation of strategies that bridge internal and external changes. This detailed account matters because it not only demystifies the challenges of ADHD management but also offers concrete frameworks that others can adopt. The emphasis on medication as a foundational step, paired with tactical system design (e.g., using digital tools as cognitive prostheses), highlights an integrative and systematic approach to overcoming the inherent difficulties of ADHD, while also addressing the societal stigma (“pill-shaming”) that can hinder individuals from seeking help.

In summary, this section of “Notes on Managing ADHD” encapsulates a multi-dimensional approach to dealing with ADHD by arguing that:
• Biological factors necessitate chemical intervention,
• Cognitive systems like todo lists act as memory and organizational extensions,
• Self-management results from a dynamic dance between internal changes (like medication) and external scaffolding (systems and habits),
• Technical details and analogies (such as comparing mental energy to voltage) provide a nuanced understanding of why certain tasks are more challenging at different times of the day.
Together, these findings build a robust framework for understanding ADHD management, illustrating how integrating pharmacological and strategic tools can precipitate both immediate improvements and long-term personal growth.
