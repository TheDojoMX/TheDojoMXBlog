TLDR:
• The defining feature of post-2020 AI is its unprecedented scale.
• Major supporting points include the vast resources consumed by modern AI models and the significant consequences of scaling, such as increased capability and resource concentration.
• The primary conclusion is that training these large models requires substantial resources, resulting in a model-as-a-service landscape dominated by a few organizations.

1. Defining Characteristics of Post-2020 AI
   • The defining feature of post-2020 AI is scale.
   • AI models (such as ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Midjourney) operate at a scale that consumes a significant portion of the world’s electricity.

2. Consequences of Scaling AI Models
   • There are two major consequences of scaling AI models:
     1. AI models are becoming more powerful and capable of handling a broader range of tasks.
     2. Training these models requires substantial resources that only a few organizations can afford.

3. Impact on the AI Landscape
   • This resource concentration has led to the emergence of “model as a service,” where models developed by a few organizations are made available for others to use as a service.
