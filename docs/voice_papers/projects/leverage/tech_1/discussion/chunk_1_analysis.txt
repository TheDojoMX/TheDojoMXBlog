• Experiments with AI include work on "01 preview 01", deep research, and most recently focus on agents.
• An image generated by ChatGPT shows a budding flower that appears static for 10 minutes but, over a long period, evolves into a full-blown rose.
• Humans are more perceptive to changes on a minute or hour scale; changes over days, years, or decades are less likely to be noticed despite underlying transformations.
• AI is described as technology that evolves over years or decades.
• Leverage is defined as a mechanism where a small or unchanged input produces a much larger output.
• Example from classical mechanics: applying a downward force on the left side of a lever can lift a 1 kilogram mass on the right; enlarging the lever can increase the multiplication factor to a 3x output.
• Three types of leverage (according to Naval Rob’s categorization) are specified:
 – Human labor: Using thousands of workers to complete tasks like building a pyramid, where individual input remains constant but total output increases.
 – Capital: Borrowing funds (e.g., investing 200K to purchase a million-dollar property by borrowing 800K) can amplify returns when a property’s valuation doubles.
 – Code and media: Writing code for an app allows each new user to gain value without additional work; similarly, posting a lecture online (e.g., on YouTube) provides incremental value with each additional view.
• The content notes that new leverage mechanisms can generate larger values and returns, but increased competition can reduce the effectiveness of any single leverage type.
• AI is posited as a new form of leverage that expands its impact from individuals to groups and ultimately to benefits for all humanity.
• At the individual level, AI (specifically ChatGPT) is used in an educational context.
