The complete content of Section 3 reads as follows:
"arking about these people, but I meant what I said: they’re smarter than me. And when they get over this affectation, they’re going to make coding agents profoundly more effective than they are today."

In this brief yet potent closing remark, the author intertwines self-reflection with high expectations for the future of coding agents. Despite an initial tone of casual dismissal—or perhaps playful self-deprecation—the author acknowledges that the peers he refers to are indeed smarter than him. The term “affectation” suggests that there is a current veneer or pretense that, once dropped, will reveal their true competence. This implies that when these individuals fully commit their intellectual prowess without any hindrance, they will accelerate significant improvements in the design and operation of coding agents. 

The significance here is multifaceted: it not only underscores the latent potential within the community of smart developers but also foreshadows a future shift where AI-assisted systems (the coding agents) will evolve to become far more sophisticated and effective. This remark encapsulates a broader argument found throughout the document regarding the inevitable, transformative impact of AI on software development. It reinforces that while initial skepticism and cautious approaches may persist, the mature integration of LLMs into programming practices—guided by the best minds—will drive a revolutionary leap in productivity and efficiency.

Thus, this section, though concise, serves as a capstone that connects the intellectual self-awareness of the author with a confident prediction: as those smart individuals drop their pretensions and fully embrace refined, practical implementations, the resulting advancements in coding agents will profoundly reshape the landscape of software development.
