10. DISCUSSION
Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems – vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, sometimes exceedingly beautiful
– Douglas R. Hofstadter, I Am a Strange Loop

Many have posited that loops, recursion, and reflective broadcasting are somehow central to the emergence of consciousness. But to the best of our knowledge, previous accounts have failed to recognize the centrality of the reality model—the entire epistemic field of our experience. For us, the capacity of intelligent systems to generate and reflectively share a global, phenomenal, and unified model of reality is the cornerstone of consciousness. This places experiential contents themselves at the very center of consciousness rather than a distinct self, an agent, or some other separable and dualistic force. The organism makes sense of their reality and then the emergent image of reality is shared perpetually with the reality model itself—continuously looping and confirming its own existence with every new lesson and every new movement.

In computational terms, we have proposed three conditions for conscious experience. The first condition is the generation of a unified reality model or epistemic field, which determines the contents that can become aware. The second is inferential competition, where only inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty are bound into a pragmatic reality model, establishing the threshold for consciousness and Bayesian binding. The third condition is epistemic depth: the reflective sharing of the reality model throughout the hierarchical system. This sharing creates a recursive (beautiful) loop that enables the reality model to contain knowledge of its own existence (formalized as hyper-modeling).

This section is significant in its depth and nuance. It presents evidence and arguments showing that practices such as deep meditation can lead to a temporary cessation or unbinding of the reality model—what some traditions call a reset—whereby awareness collapses as active inference no longer achieves a global coherence. Importantly, this deconstruction not only explains meditative cessation but also illuminates how psychedelics might expand consciousness by increasing epistemic depth. The discussion integrates classical Buddhist insights with computational models of Bayesian inference, suggesting that expanded recursivity and hyper-modeling are central to understanding how both altered states (like those induced by meditation or psychedelics) and everyday conscious awareness emerge. It further implies that changes in functional connectivity, particularly in thalamo-cortical circuits, might underlie these shifts, offering a neurobiological substrate for the phenomenological experience of expanded or luminous awareness.

Thus, the section not only provides a multifaceted account of how deconstructive practices affect the mind’s generative model but also bridges interdisciplinary insights—from contemplative traditions and psychedelic research to active inference theory—thereby challenging conventional views on the necessity of persistent self-modeling for consciousness. The recursive “beautiful loop” of inferential competition and epistemic depth is posited as the core mechanism through which the reality model continually confirms its own existence, leading to moments of profound insight, transformative cognitive flexibility, and even transient mystical absorption.
