==================================================
The complete content of Section 7 from “A Beautiful Loop:” is presented below. In this section the authors deeply analyze minimal phenomenal experience (MPE) by focusing on a parsimonious model of consciousness—one that centers on the most basic form of awareness rather than the usual self‐identity, agency, or temporality. The section starts by outlining the philosophical idea of MPE as a state of pure, contentless or minimally contented wakeful awareness—a “tonic alertness” described by Metzinger (2020; 2024) and corroborated by contemplative traditions. This state is characterized by an openness and epistemic potential (i.e., a non-egoic capacity for knowledge and perception) that is both luminous and marked by clarity inherent in emptiness.

The authors agree with Metzinger’s characterization but also emphasize, following Josipovic, that the recursion of non-dual awareness is sui generis: the system’s capacity to be aware of its own reality model does not depend on specific contents. Instead, recursive sharing—where the reality model continuously incorporates its own structure and weighting rules (termed hyper-modeling)—enables the system to “know itself” simultaneously as both the content and the content that is known. Formally, they propose that MPE occurs when epistemic depth is maximized and the reality model is minimal or contentless. Under these circumstances, recursive broadcasting causes the recursion (or luminosity) to dominate the inferential competition, thereby generating a reflective awareness of awareness without a time‐lag; all processes occur as part of one continuous loop.

The section uses the analogy of acoustic feedback—a speaker’s sound feeding back into the microphone—to depict this “beautiful loop” (inspired by Hofstadter, 2007). In this loop the system’s focus on knowing is in fact a process of simplification (reducing complex content) that by its recursive nature continuously reinforces the system’s self-awareness. As a consequence, the intentional simplicity of the reality model (nondual, contentless, yet recursively self-validating) naturally maps onto various phenomenological reports of MPE, which are described as luminous, simple, singular, and non-dual. Moreover, when a meditative state includes an affective component (resulting in bliss), the system’s overwhelmingly precise explanation of that affective signal minimizes uncertainty and tension—thus forming a sustained positive affect analogous to what in Buddhist traditions is referenced as Jhānas.

The authors also note that the purest forms of MPE are likely to occur during deep sleep when additional contents are inactive, permitting recursion to dominate the reality model. They suggest that mindful training during wakefulness may increase the habitual propensity for recursion, even during sleep. As a logical extension of their framework, they illustrate in a figure how MPE and other meditation-related states (including focused attention, open awareness, and non-dual awareness) can be mapped as functions of epistemic depth, levels of abstraction, and the distribution of precision. In this illustration, focused attention is depicted as having low-to-medium abstraction and epistemic depth, where mindful thought (with higher epistemic depth) competes with mind-wandering; open awareness, by contrast, is characterized by high epistemic depth with a dispersed precision distribution; and non-dual awareness exhibits luminous awareness regardless of the level of abstraction—with MPE being situated at the point of minimal abstraction, highly focused precision, and very high epistemic depth, such that the recursive knowingness of the system dominates the inferential process.

A second core notion discussed is “dereification”—the process by which phenomena are recognized as constructs rather than inherently real. In this framework, increasing epistemic depth (the ability to observe one’s internal reality model) promotes dereification and can lead to instances of phenomenal opacity (where the process of content formation is itself made available to introspection). This explicit recognition is in line with classical Buddhist teachings on the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and non-self nature (anicca, dukkha, anattā) of experiences. Interestingly, the authors entertain the possibility that MPE itself might be subject to dereification and deconstruction as seen in advanced meditative practices, where nirodha (or cessation) events may occur. In these events, the reality model transiently collapses or “unbinds,” resulting in a reset-like state sometimes observed as a complete cessation of experience.

Thus, Section 7 is significant on several levels:
• It argues that minimal phenomenal experience can be modeled as a state with maximal epistemic depth and minimal content, emerging from recursive broadcasting within a unified generative model (the “beautiful loop”).
• It provides both a mechanistic explanation (via inferential competition and hyper-modeling) and a phenomenological one (experiences of lucidity, simplicity, and even bliss) for MPE.
• It integrates contemplative insights (from Buddhist thought and traditions) with modern computational approaches to consciousness, offering a bridge between abstract theory and observable meditative phenomena.
• It further addresses the role of dereification and insight in transforming how experiences are constructed, thereby challenging our traditional understanding of what constitutes the content and quality of awareness.

“ermitting a rapidly growing triangulation of these unusual—yet
ancient and widespread—conscious states .
We take a particular interest here in modeling what is known as minimal phenomenal experience . The philosophical idea is that
the best model of consciousness is the simplest one: an explanation that takes the most basic or minimal form of awareness
as its target. This approach aims to avoid conflating consciousness as such with particular expressions of
it, including self-hood, agency, time, or a first-person perspective (Metzinger, 2020; 2024). The best
examples include pure, or contentless awareness experiences, lucid dreamless sleep, or other minimal nondual awareness events reported by many contemplative traditions .
Some important groundwork already exists (cf. Metzinger, 2020; 2024; Josipovic, 2019). According to
Metzinger, MPE may correspond to the phenomenology of "tonic alertness" — a state of bare wakeful
awareness without any specific content. It is an abstract, contentless experience of "openness" and epistemic
potential—a non-egoic representation of the mere capacity for knowledge and perception (i. e., the epistemic
space). It is also luminous,... clarity inseparable from emptiness (Lingpa, 2014, pp. 14–15, quoted in
Metzinger, 2020). Our view is thoroughly in agreement with Metzinger s general phenomenological
characterization. However, we also agree with Josipovic that the recursion of non-dual awareness is
sui generis, a unique and holistic capacity to non-conceptually become aware of the reality model. But
crucially, this recursion does not depend upon any particular contents, and is not abstract. The reality model,
through recursive sharing of its own structure and weighting rules (i. e., hyper-modeling), can know-itself
continuously and simultaneously as both the content and the content that is known.
Formally, we propose that MPE occurs when: epistemic depth is maximally high, and the reality model
is contentless (minimal precision across the abstraction hierarchy). Due to recursive broadcasting, this
results in the recursion (i. e., luminosity) becoming the dominant input of the reality model (i. e., perpetually
winning the inferential competition). This results in a kind of reflective recursion—awareness of awareness.
But it is misleading to imagine this as dualistic or something that takes time. The input to the reality model,
the reflective sharing, and inferential competition, are all co-occurring in the system. They are all part of
one continuous process. It is a bit like acoustic feedback: the sound from a loudspeaker reenters the
microphone and forms a perpetual loop. What emerges is what we can poetically call a beautiful rather
than strange loop (Hofstadter, 2007); a kind of toroidal (cf. Figure) epistemicity that arises out of the
global function rather than specific informational content or meta-representation.
Metaphorically, it is as if the system is focused on its own capacity to know. But as discussed earlier,
focus is really simplification; and knowing is really recursion. Hence, if the reality model is simple enough
that the only signal that wins the inferential competition is the recursion itself, then the recursion
continuously shares itself with itself. This maps onto the phenomenal character of MPE (Metzinger, 2020),
as luminous, simple, singular, non-dual, and true (i. e., precise). In the context of some minimal affect (i. e.,
approximate MPE), it also makes sense that it is blissful—there may be one affective signal that is almost
perfectly explained by the model, hence uncertainty and associated tensions are exceedingly low compared
to ordinary life. Moreover, by making bliss, joy, or happiness, the focus (i. e., high precision content in a
simplified reality model), one can entrain a beautiful loop of sustained positive affect and awareness,
analogous to the high pitched whistle of acoustic feedback described above, and reminiscent of what
Buddhist s call Jhānas .
It is unsurprising that the most truly minimal versions of MPE occur during deep sleep where other
contents are the least active and recursion can dominate the reality model, and that such experiences might
be more common among contemplatives who train in mindfulness and open awareness. Increasing
epistemic depth during the day may reasonably be expected to entrain a habit of recursion such that it occurs
during sleep. Similar to the way that we may dream about the events of our day; by habitually becoming
aware of our reality model (conscious gestalt), we may increase inertia for reflective (non-dual) awareness
during the night. In Figure, we extend our framework beyond MPE to other meditative states, including
focused attention, open awareness, and non-dual awareness .
Another central notion in contemplative science is dereification. Dereification refers to the recognition
that experiential phenomena are constructs rather than inherent realities . This shift in
perspective involves disengaging from the habitual tendency to reify thoughts, emotions, and experiences
as solid, enduring entities . Within our framework, dereification is associated with
increasing epistemic depth (i. e., being able to mindfully witness the reality model) combined with insight
. Insight can occur because epistemic depth creates a kind
of distance that allows the hyper generative-model to opacify, introspect, interrogate, and therefore change
the nature of contents in the reality model. That is, when the reality model is reflectively known, then it can
be introspected as an experiential object (an input onto itself). To illustrate: in classical Buddhism, students
are taught to actively recognize three characteristics of experience (anicca or impermanence, dukkha or
unsatisfactoriness, and anattā or not-self). By making contents of the reality model an object of awareness
(epistemic depth) and inquiring into the three characteristics (Burbea, 2014), one s priors, which influence
experience, may begin to restructure (i. e., insight).
Figure
Key meditation-related states as a function of abstraction, precision distribution, and epistemic depth
Note. On the left is a 3D figure illustrating different meditation states (i. e., not practices or traits) as a function of epistemic depth
(vertical axis), abstraction (horizontal axis), and precision distribution (diagonal axis, cf. right figure). The focused attention state
is represented by a light green box on the bottom left of the cuboid, with low-medium abstraction, low-medium epistemic depth,
and a gathered precision distribution. Two types of thinking are presented on the bottom right of the box: mindful thought and
mind wandering. Both have gathered precision and high abstraction. The main difference between these two types of thinking is
that mindful thought is higher in epistemic depth—there is more awareness of the flow of thoughts. In the space above these boxes,
located towards the back of the figure, is a light salmon colored box representing the open awareness state . The
open awareness state is characterized by higher epistemic depth than focused attention and thinking, a wide range of abstraction
levels, and a relatively dispersed precision distribution. Across the whole top layer of the cuboid is a blue box representing nondual awareness , which has the distinct characteristic of high epistemic depth—
i. e., a luminous awareness—which can be present at any level of abstraction and precision-distribution. Finally, in the bottom left
corner of the non-dual awareness slab is a black rectangle representing MPE. MPE has low abstraction, a highly gathered precision
distribution—associated with a singular experiential content—and high epistemic depth. Therefore, for MPE, the knowingness
recursively dominates the highly simplified reality model. The figure on the right illustrates what we mean by precision distribution
and abstraction: The x-axis illustrates different levels of abstraction and the red distributions illustrate a
dispersed, broad, or diverse distribution of precision throughout the processing hierarchy; whereas the blue distribution illustrates
a situation where the mind is focused, i. e., has a gathered distribution of precision on a particular level of abstraction.
As epistemic depth increases, there is an increased likelihood of the dereification of phenomena. That
is, phenomena lose the sense of being perceived as inherently real, but there is also an increased likelihood
of phenomenal opacity. When the process of conscious mental content formation is itself available for
introspection then the mental contents are said to be phenomenally opaque, otherwise the mental content
are phenomenally transparent (or hidden, Metzinger, 2024, p.507). Thus, high levels of epistemic depth
increase the probability, especially for advanced meditators, that phenomena will be perceived as mental
constructions and therefore the commonsense phenomenology of naïve realism dissolves. When
phenomena are so perceived, they are said in Buddhist terms to be empty (śūnyatā, Burbea 2014).
A curious possibility is that MPE itself can become the target of dereification and deconstruction, as
some meditators propose (Burbea, 2014; Sayadaw, 2016). This idea is consistent with recent work on the
topic of nirodha (or cessation) events that can happen during advanced stages of meditation . Cessations are characterized by brief, and in rare cases long, periods of total absence
wherein no experience occurs (akin to endogenous general anesthesia). Nirodha is not a state like deep sleep
or a mind blank, but a profoundly deconstructed state where the reality model, and consciousness,
transiently collapses or unbinds (Agrawal & Laukkonen, 2024; Letheby, 2017), resulting in intense aftereffects8 sometimes described as a reset (Dutt, 1964). Indeed, practitioners may not always notice that an
absence has occurred, instead what is noticed is the shift or axiomatic change in perspective.”

In summary, Section 7 robustly develops the idea that consciousness, at its most minimal form, can be understood as a dynamic, recursive process in which a simplified and contentless reality model self-validates through continuous, non-linear feedback. This recursive “beautiful loop” is not merely a sequential series of inferences but an integrated, simultaneous process that gives rise to a luminous and self-reflective awareness. It bridges technical active inference principles (such as epistemic depth and inferential competition) with rich phenomenological accounts drawn from contemplative traditions—framing even the most ephemeral experiences like deep sleep or meditative bliss as manifestations of a self-recursive, generative process. This framework challenges conventional views on the prerequisites for consciousness by suggesting that minimal awareness, once it achieves the right balance of simplicity and recursive self-knowledge, can not only be complete in itself but also serve as a scaffold for more complex states of conscious experience.
