effects8 sometimes described as a reset (Dutt, 1964). Indeed, practitioners may not always notice that an absence has occurred, instead what is noticed is the shift or axiomatic change in perspective. But in some (rarer) cases, there may be a clear insight of cessation—the nature of mind without mind—a paradoxical knowing of unbinding itself (Thanissaro, 2012). 

Interestingly, the practices that lead to cessation involve actively deconstructing the reality model, including the self (cf. the five aggregates, Boisvert, 1995). Since the reality model is one of our conditions for consciousness, then such deep deconstruction may lead to a transient failure to generate a coherent reality model and thus a collapse of awareness (i. e., Bayesian unbinding). Within classical Buddhist practice, the purpose of cessation is of course not to be permanently unconscious, but to transform the mind and reduce suffering. As described in Burbea :
Through letting go of clinging more and more totally and deeply, the world of experience fades and ceases;
and seeing and understanding this is of great significance:... I say that the end of the world cannot be known,
seen, or reached by traveling. Yet… I also say that without reaching the end of the world there is no making an
end to dukkha. - Cosmos Loka Sutta

Formally, we hypothesize that cessations of awareness occur when the inferential competition fails to reach global coherence due to deconstructive meditation, which steadily accumulates evidence against the coherence of the reality model. This Bayesian unbinding of the reality model includes the recursion signal necessary for MPE. In Mahāyāna Buddhist terms, this reveals the groundlessness, substrate independence, or emptiness, of all phenomena including consciousness and emptiness itself. Under the right conditions, such an insight may be associated with significant changes to cognition, perception, and self-experience (Berkovich-Ohana, 2017; Berkovich-Ohana, 2024).

Speculatively, a complete deconstruction of the reality model may also unveil the capacity to interrogate the threshold of consciousness (cf. Figure), via recursion at very low levels of abstraction (i. e., pratītyasamutpāda or dependent origination). The possible experiences and states that can occur during meditation are of course multitudinous. Our goal here has been to briefly characterize some of the more empirically informed categories of meditation states and insights.

After-effects may include a profound sense of clarity, freshness, cognitive and emotional flexibility, positive affect, and compassion. An improved capacity to meditate may also occur (Ingram, 2018).

THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE
The unique phenomenological character of the psychedelic experience has been something particularly challenging to integrate within ToCs. One popular theory of psychedelic action is the Relaxed Beliefs Under Psychedelics model (i. e., REBUS; Carhart-Harris & Friston, 2019), which is also based on active inference. Under this theory, psychedelics relax abstract beliefs (i. e., reduce their precision) leading to a kind of anarchic (or entropic) neural activity, dominated by bottom-up prediction-errors and low-level sensory processing. This model seems to provide a parsimonious account of ego-dissolution, novel perspectives and insights, heightened sensory details, altered time perception, and hallucinations, while also being supported by some of the neural effects of psychedelics (Carhart-Harris, 2018).

There is however an aspect of the psychedelic experience not easily captured by existing theories. And yet, this quality is so central to the psychedelic experience that it is arguably its most notable and surprising quality. It is the sensation that psychedelics expand consciousness, heighten awareness, or reveal higher states of consciousness. This feeling of increased awareness is supported by the finding that psychedelics lead to boosted mindfulness post-acutely and increases in the noetic feeling, i. e., the sense of knowing and the global quality of realness or truthiness.

What might Beautiful Loop Theory say about these (relatively) unexplained phenomena within the psychedelic experience? We conjecture that psychedelics can reliably increase epistemic depth, which naturally leads to a sensation of expanded consciousness, knowingness (noeticism), and mindfulness, all captured by a single parameter. In other words, an increased recursivity and hyper-modeling would be expected to correspond with the feeling that one is more conscious of their world and themselves, because they (quite literally) are. Indeed, it may be that changes in contents of the experience are accounted for by relaxation of abstract beliefs (cf. REBUS), whereas changes in the global qualities of consciousness may be best explained by increases in epistemic depth (though the two are interrelated). But crucially, given the concomitant relaxation of learned beliefs, the feeling of expanded awareness may not necessarily favor accurate models.

Increased epistemic depth also resonates with some of the introspective qualities of psychedelics, including the sense of discovering hidden aspects of oneself and the psyche-delic (i. e., mind-manifesting) nature of the experience more broadly (Lyon, 2024). If epistemic depth increases knowing what one knows, and beliefs are relaxed, it makes sense that one encounters features of their reality model that are normally obscured. Given the previous section, we may also now hypothesize that the long-speculated relationship or similarity between psychedelics and meditation is also driven by epistemic depth (Letheby, 2022). That is, both meditation and psychedelics can boost luminosity—the clarity and scope of awareness driven by recursive sharing of the structure and weighting rules of the generative model with itself. Hence, both can also result in transient states of mystical absorption, or MPE, wherein this pure knowingness signal becomes, interestingly, according to ChatGPT 4o: A rough overall estimate might put mentions of psychedelics in relation to expanding awareness/consciousness in the low tens of thousands per year across all these [online] platforms combined, globally. Or, as Letheby puts it, they both move contents... along the continuum from phenomenal transparency to opacity—the central (high-precision) feature of the reality model that is known, replacing ego and self-other boundaries with a kind of pure consciousness event.

While the precise neural mechanisms underlying our proposal needs to be the subject of future work, it is a hallmark finding that psychedelics increase functional connectivity, particularly in thalamo-cortical circuits. Such decreased segregation between neural regions, and particularly the widespread connectivity of the thalamus, may be associated with widespread global sharing of the reality model with the rest of the system. The quality of psychedelic experiences is of course not uniform, and can vary substantially with different doses, different substances, different intentions, different people, and different contexts (Hartogsohn, 2016). This nonuniformity of experience applies especially across the time course of a psychedelic experience during which individuals may oscillate between extreme moments of absorption with relatively low epistemic depth followed by moments of high epistemic depth, depending on various features of set, setting, and dose. Similar to findings of sudden lucidity within dreaming, it may be that acute moments of becoming more conscious of the reality model (i. e., high epistemic depth) may be particularly associated with transient boosts in prefrontal activity combined with high global, functional connectivity. Testing these hypotheses requires methods that emphasize the neurophenomenology of psychedelics —the flow and correlation of subjective experience and neural activity over time.

10. DISCUSSION
Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems – vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, sometimes exceedingly beautiful

Many have posited that loops, recursion, and reflective broadcasting are somehow central to the emergence of consciousness. But to the best of our knowledge, previous accounts have failed to recognize the centrality of the reality model—the entire epistemic field of our experience. For us, the capacity of intelligent systems to generate and reflectively share a global, phenomenal, and unified model of reality is the cornerstone of consciousness. This places experiential contents themselves at the very center of consciousness rather than a distinct self, an agent, or some other separable and dualistic force. The organism makes sense of their reality and then the emergent image of reality is shared perpetually with the reality model itself—continuously looping and confirming its own existence with every new lesson and every new movement.

In computational terms, we have proposed three conditions for conscious experience. The first condition is the generation of a unified reality model or epistemic field, which determines the contents that can become aware. The second is inferential competition, where only inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty are bound into a pragmatic reality model, establishing the threshold for consciousness and Bayesian binding. The third condition is epistemic depth: the reflective sharing of the reality model throughout the hierarchical system. This sharing creates a recursive (beautiful) loop that enables the reality model to contain knowledge of its own existence (formalized as hyper-modeling).

This section is significant in its depth and nuance. It presents evidence and arguments showing that practices such as deep meditation can lead to a temporary cessation or unbinding of the reality model—what some traditions call a reset—whereby awareness collapses as active inference no longer achieves a global coherence. Importantly, this deconstruction not only explains meditative cessation but also illuminates how psychedelics might expand consciousness by increasing epistemic depth. The discussion integrates classical Buddhist insights with computational models of Bayesian inference, suggesting that expanded recursivity and hyper-modeling are central to understanding how both altered states (like those induced by meditation or psychedelics) and everyday conscious awareness emerge. It further implies that changes in functional connectivity, particularly in thalamo-cortical circuits, might underlie these shifts, offering a neurobiological substrate for the phenomenological experience of expanded or luminous awareness.

Thus, the section not only provides a multifaceted account of how deconstructive practices affect the mind’s generative model but also bridges interdisciplinary insights—from contemplative traditions and psychedelic research to active inference theory—thereby challenging conventional views on the necessity of persistent self-modeling for consciousness. The recursive “beautiful loop” of inferential competition and epistemic depth is posited as the core mechanism through which the reality model continually confirms its own existence, leading to moments of profound insight, transformative cognitive flexibility, and even transient mystical absorption.

This comprehensive discussion matters because it offers a unifying theoretical framework that can account for a wide range of conscious experiences—from the quiet moments of meditative cessation to the vivid, expansive states induced by psychedelics—by focusing on the recursive, self-validating nature of the brain’s internal model of reality.
