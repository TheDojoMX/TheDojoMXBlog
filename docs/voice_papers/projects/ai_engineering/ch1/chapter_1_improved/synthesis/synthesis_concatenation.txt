1. OVERVIEW & INTRODUCTION
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
CHAPTER
Introduction to Building AI Applications with Foundation Models

• “If I could use only one word to describe AI post-2020, it’d be scale. The AI models behind applications like ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Midjourney are at such a scale that they’re consuming a nontrivial portion of the world’s electricity, and we’re at risk of running out of publicly available internet data to train them.”
• The chapter explains how scaling up AI models has two major consequences:
  – Models are becoming more powerful and capable of a broader range of tasks, enhancing productivity and quality of life.
  – Training these models requires significant resources, which has led to the rise of “model as a service.”
• It emphasizes that while building applications on ML models is not new, the arrival of huge, readily available models (foundation models) creates new possibilities and challenges.
• The chapter lays out an overview of foundation models, successful AI use cases, and a new AI stack. It also contrasts today’s AI engineering with traditional ML engineering and highlights the rapid emergence of AI engineering as a discipline.

2. FROM LANGUAGE MODELS TO FOUNDATION MODELS
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A. Early Language Models & Evolution
 • Language models encode statistical information about language – for example, predicting that “blue” might fill the blank in “My favorite color is __.”
 • Historical examples:
   – Sherlock Holmes used simple statistics in “The Adventure of the Dancing Men.”
   – Claude Shannon’s work on “Prediction and Entropy of Printed English” still informs modeling.
 • Early language models dealt with one language; modern ones involve multiple languages.
 
B. Understanding Tokens & Tokenization
 • A token is the basic unit (character, word, or sub-word) chosen by the model; for example, GPT‑4 tokenizes “I can’t wait to build AI applications” into nine tokens.
 • Tokenization breaks text into tokens, with vocabulary size controlling the distinct units available.
 • Discussion on why tokens are preferred over words or characters:
  1. Tokens capture meaningful sub-word components.
  2. They reduce the vocabulary size.
  3. They handle unknown words effectively.

C. Self‑Supervision & Types of Language Models
 • Self‑supervision is the method by which language models are trained using the input data as both labels and context.
 • Differentiation between masked language models (e.g., BERT) and autoregressive language models (used for text generation).
 • Explanation of “completion” – the model predicts the subsequent token(s) based on preceding text.
 • Discussion of open‑ended outputs characteristic of generative AI.
 • The probabilistic nature of these outputs makes them powerful for tasks like translation, summarization, coding, and more.

D. Transition to Foundation Models
 • While traditional language models worked only with text, foundation models integrate additional modalities (images, videos, 3D assets, protein structures, etc.) to work in the real world.
 • Models like GPT‑4V and Claude 3 are examples of multimodal models.
 • Discussion of CLIP as an early multimodal embedding model, and how these models have shifted from task‑specific to general‑purpose capabilities.

4. PLANNING AI APPLICATIONS
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A. Use Case Evaluation
 • Discussion on why one might build or adopt an AI application:

B. Determining the Role of AI vs. Humans
 • Differentiating between critical versus complementary roles for AI.

  – Proactive features: precomputed responses like traffic alerts.
 • Dynamic versus static AI features and potential approaches (individualized models or shared models updated periodically).

C. AI Product Defensibility & Competitive Advantages
 • Challenges: low entry barriers mean an application can quickly become duplicated by larger companies.
 • Types of competitive moats:

6. AI ENGINEERING VERSUS MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEERING
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
A. Key Differences
 1. Model Usage:
  • Traditional ML engineering often involves training models from scratch.
  • AI engineering leverages pre‑trained foundation models, focusing on model adaptation rather than building models from the ground up.
 2. Resource Scale & Compute:
  • Foundation models are larger, more compute‑intensive, and come with higher latency, requiring more robust hardware (e.g., hundreds or thousands of GPUs).
 3. Open‑Ended Outputs & Evaluation Challenges:
  • Foundation models produce open‑ended outputs, making evaluation more challenging than in close‑ended ML tasks.

B. Techniques for Model Adaptation
 • Prompt‑based techniques (prompt engineering) adapt models without weight updates.
 • Finetuning involves updating model weights for improved performance on specific tasks.
 • Explanation of terms: pre‑training (training from scratch), finetuning (continuing training on new data), and post‑training (further refinement by model developers versus application developers).

C. Shifting Roles & Skill Sets
 • Traditional ML engineers have deep knowledge in algorithms, gradient descent, and loss functions.
 • AI engineers increasingly come from full‑stack or software development backgrounds, capable of rapid iteration, and are now responsible for integrating models into high‑quality user experiences.
 • The convergence of front‑end and back‑end skills as AI interfaces become more complex.
