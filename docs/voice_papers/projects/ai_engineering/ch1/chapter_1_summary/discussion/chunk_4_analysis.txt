The section begins by drawing a clear distinction between working with foundation models and traditional ML models—highlighting that “ML engineering” in its classic sense doesn’t fully capture the nuances of fine‐tuning and adapting these expansive models. The author argues that although traditional ML was rooted in building models for specific tasks such as fraud detection or recommendations, foundation models are general-purpose, thereby requiring an evolution in the engineering process. Rather than naming all processes with an “Ops” suffix, the focus is on “engineering” these models to achieve desired outcomes. This shift is further endorsed by a survey of 20 developers where “AI engineering” emerged as the preferred term, lending credibility to the argument by adopting the community’s language rather than imposing a new jargon.

A pivotal point of the text is the “Rise of AI Engineering” and the massive expansion of AI applications today. As evidence, the author mentions data from theresanaiforthat.com (as of September 16, 2024) that lists over 16,814 AIs for 14,688 tasks and 4,803 jobs. This underscores the rapid growth and widespread adoption of AI systems, reinforcing the claim that now is an opportune moment to develop AI applications using foundation models.

The discussion then broadens to explore the nearly limitless use cases of these models. The author explains that while traditional use cases were easier to categorize, the diversity of current applications defies neat classification. Examples from different surveys are cited—AWS distinguishes among customer experience, employee productivity, and process optimization; O’Reilly’s survey divides use cases into eight categories (from coding and data analysis to art and web design), and Deloitte along with Gartner even categorize them by value capture. For instance, Gartner’s survey from 2023 notes that 7% of executives identified “business continuity” as a driver for adopting generative AI. Such contrasting yet complementary categorization schemes illustrate the complexities in defining “use cases,” with real-world applications spanning industries and functions.

To add depth, the text next presents concrete data through studies such as Eloundou et al.’s research on occupational exposure to AI. The study quantitatively shows that some professions (interpreters, translators, tax preparers, web designers, and writers) are nearly 100% “exposed”—meaning that AI can cut their task time by at least 50%—while others like cooks or stonemasons see negligible exposure. Table-2, included in the text, lists occupations with the highest exposure across multiple human annotations (α, β, ζ), reinforcing the argument that the potential for AI applications is both vast and unevenly distributed across fields.

Further, the section delves into the real-world analysis of AI use cases through a combination of interviews with 50 companies and the author’s study of over 100 case studies, as well as an examination of 205 open source AI applications on GitHub. These empirical investigations have resulted in a categorization into eight groups (as presented in Table-3) encompassing areas like coding, image/video processing, design, writing, education, customer support, information aggregation, market research, and more. The distribution analysis (illustrated by Figure-7) indicates trends in open source projects—although some popular verticals like education or writing are less represented in open repositories, likely due to their dominance in enterprise settings.

One of the most notable segments of the discussion centers on coding as a primary use case for foundation models. Coding not only appears as the most popular application by multiple surveys, but the author supports its prevalence through powerful examples: GitHub Copilot reached over $100 million in annual recurring revenue just two years after launch. Moreover, notable funding rounds—such as Magic raising $320 million and Anysphere $60 million—demonstrate financial validation. Additionally, open-source projects like gpt-engineer and screenshot-to-code quickly garnered 50,000 stars on GitHub, exemplifying both community enthusiasm and rapidly growing practical applications. The text also details specific coding tasks including data extraction from documents, language translation to code, UI generation from screenshots, and even niche functionalities like auto-documenting or generating commit messages.

Importantly, the section does not ignore the inherent debates and limitations. It raises the question of whether AI can fully automate software engineering by mentioning Jensen Huang’s bold prediction that AI might eventually replace human coders—a provocative idea that invites reflection on the broader implications for the profession. The discussion implies that although AI offers transformative assistance, certain challenges (such as ensuring consistent quality, understanding context deeply, and managing risks) continue to shape the evolution of AI engineering.

In summary, this section thoroughly dissects the transformative role of foundation models within modern AI engineering. It weaves together surveys, empirical case studies, quantitative data, and real-world examples to illustrate that the new era of AI is characterized by general-purpose models capable of addressing a myriad of tasks across various sectors. The analysis not only underscores the technical shift—from task-specific systems to highly versatile foundation models—but also highlights socio-economic impacts, such as the rapid democratization of AI through “models as a service” and the ensuing explosion of AI-driven innovations. This comprehensive exploration sets the stage for subsequent chapters by providing both technical detail and contextual understanding, ensuring that discussions on AI engineering, model deployment, and evolving use cases are grounded in a deep appreciation of both the capabilities and the limits of foundation models.
