If it's too short, EXPAND it significantly.\n            CRITICAL: Ensure technical level is technical - include deep technical analysis.\n            \n            MANDATORY VOICE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:\n            1. Create a SINGLE, CONTINUOUS text ready for a voice actor to read\n            2. Markdown formatting, but NO headers, NO bullet points, NO lists\n            3. Convert ALL content into natural, flowing sentences\n            4. Replace any remaining bullet points with complete sentences\n            5. Ensure PERFECT flow from sentence to sentence\n            6. Remove formatting marks: #, -, •, etc for titles and subtitles, but keep for bold and italic text\n            7. Make sure sentences are not too long or complex for voice delivery\n            8. Write naturally in Spanish without academic formalities\n            9. Remove any remaining conversational artifacts (\"como mencionamos antes\", \"en nuestra discusión\")\n            10. Ensure seamless transitions between concepts\n            11. Maintain the conversational richness but in a single educator voice\n            12. Read the text mentally to ensure it sounds natural when spoken\n            13. Ensure proper pronunciation flow for difficult technical terms\n            14. Remove any repetitive content that may have emerged from multiple discussions\n            15. Maintain the depth gained from agent conversations while ensuring clarity\n            16. Perfect pacing for natural speech rhythm\n            17. Eliminate any phrases that sound like committee work or group consensus\n            18. Make it sound like ONE expert who has deeply understood the topic\n            19. Ensure technical accuracy while maintaining conversational flow\n            20. Optimize for voice actor performance and listener engagement\n            21. This should sound like ONE VOICE teaching, not a summary of multiple voices\n            22. Avoid words that could make this sound like written by an LLM, like not often used words: \"fascinante\", \"delve\", \"revelador\"\n            23. Introduction should be a catchy hook that makes the listener want to listen to the entire video, something like a question or a statement that makes the listener want to know more\n            24. DO NOT add new content - only optimize existing content for voice delivery\n            25. DO NOT change the educational message - only improve its delivery\n            \n            CRITICAL DIDACTIC STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:\n            26. VERIFY INTRODUCTION includes preview/roadmap: Ensure there's a clear \"what you'll learn\" section early in the script\n            27. VERIFY CONCLUSION includes summary: Ensure there's a clear recap of main points at the end\n            28. REMOVE LLM WORDS: Replace any remaining \"fundamental\", \"crucial\", \"clave\" (adjective), \"esencial\", \"revelador\", \"fascinante\", \"compelling\", \"robust\", etc. with natural alternatives\n            29. HUMAN CONVERSATION: Ensure the entire script sounds like a knowledgeable person explaining something interesting, not AI-generated content\n            30. NATURAL FLOW: Check that didactic elements (preview, summary) flow naturally within the content, not as forced additions\n            26. Preserve the humor elements but ensure they flow naturally in speech\n\n            \n            LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR SPANISH:\n            \n            CRITICAL: AVOID ANGLICISMS whenever possible and use proper Spanish terms:\n            - Instead of \"link\" use \"enlace\" or \"vínculo\"\n            - Instead of \"feedback\" use \"retroalimentación\" or \"respuesta\"\n            - Insted of \"puzzle\" use \"rompecabezas\" or \"problema\"\n            - Instead of \"performance\" use \"rendimiento\" or \"desempeño\"\n            - Instead of \"input/output\" use \"entrada/salida\"\n            - Instead of \"update\" use \"actualizar\" or \"poner al día\"\n            \n            EXCEPTIONS - You CAN use anglicisms for:\n            1.
