from
companies that use AI ethically. Consumers could, for example, favor apps or products
that are transparent about their AI (similar to organic or fair-trade labels, we might see
AI ethics labels). Public pressure can push companies to self-regulate better.
Additionally, society might consider mechanisms to share AI-driven prosperity – whether
through progressive taxation of tech giants or novel ideas like data dividends (paying
people for use of their data). These socioeconomic policies are complex, but they will
increasingly become part of the conversation as AI contributes more to wealth
generation.
In sum, the overarching recommendation is proactive engagement. AI s trajectory is not
something to observe passively; all stakeholders have roles in shaping it. The next 5 and
years will bring choices – about which applications to promote, which risks to curb, and how to
distribute AI s fruits. By acting with foresight now, we can guide AI development toward
outcomes that align with human values and global well-being. The future of AI, to a large extent,
lies in our collective hands.
Artificial intelligence is poised to become one of the defining forces of the coming decade, as
transformative to society as the steam engine or electricity were in earlier eras. This research
sought to envision what the AI landscape might look like in roughly 5 years and again in
years, based on current trends and technological developments. Our analysis leads to several
overarching conclusions:
1. AI will be more powerful, pervasive, and intertwined with daily life. By 5 years (around
2030), we anticipate AI systems that are notably more capable than today s, with improvements
in natural language understanding, multi-modal perception, and autonomous decision-making.
These systems are likely to be widely deployed across industries and services – often in ways
that end-users may not even realize (embedded in appliances, vehicles, infrastructure, etc.).
Everyday tasks from scheduling to shopping to travel will increasingly be facilitated by AI behind
the scenes. By 10 years (mid-2030s), if current momentum continues, AI could achieve
quasi-general intelligence in limited domains – meaning systems that approach human-level
proficiency across a range of tasks within those domains. While strong AI or true general AI
might still be beyond reach, the boundary between narrow and general will blur as AI gets better
at learning from small data and transferring knowledge. In effect, AI will become an ever-present
utility, much like the internet is today, effectively integrated into how we work, learn, and
entertain ourselves.
2. The benefits of AI will be substantial – but so will the disruptions. On the positive side,
AI stands to greatly enhance productivity, spur innovation, and help solve complex problems.
Economically, it can create wealth and new industries (the AI economy could contribute trillions
to global GDP, as noted) (www. pwc. com). Societally, it offers tools to improve health outcomes,
education, environmental management, and more. However, these advancements come with
disruptive shifts: job displacement in certain sectors, the need for retraining on an
unprecedented scale, adjustments in regulations (e. g., traffic laws for driverless cars, medical
liability for AI diagnoses), and shifts in power structures (organizations or countries leading in AI
might concentrate wealth or influence). The coming decade will likely see tension between
those who harness AI to great advantage and those who feel left behind by automation or
insurmountable skill gaps. Managing this transition is a critical challenge – failure to do so could
result in public backlash, increased inequality, and political friction. Our conclusion is that while
AI will expand the pie of prosperity, society must actively ensure that the pieces of that pie are
equitably distributed.
3. Ethical and safe AI development is not just a moral imperative but vital for sustainable
progress. Incidents of AI causing harm – whether through biased decisions, accidents, or
malicious use – could erode trust and slow adoption of genuinely beneficial technologies. Thus,
prioritizing ethics and safety is also a way to ensure AI s long-term viability. We found
encouraging signs: researchers and even AI companies increasingly acknowledge issues like
bias, and regulators are stepping in (www. businessinsider. com). Yet, much work remains to
operationalize ethical principles into everyday AI systems. In conclusion, the trajectory toward
and 2035 must be accompanied by robust frameworks to audit algorithms, certify AI
systems (perhaps akin to FDA approvals for critical AI in healthcare, for example), and involve
diverse stakeholders in design and deployment. A key litmus test will be whether AI can be
deployed in high-stakes areas – like criminal justice, hiring, healthcare – without perpetuating
injustices. If by 2030 we have demonstrably fair and transparent AI in these domains, it will
mark a significant societal achievement.
4. International dynamics will heavily influence AI s evolution. The field of AI is global, but
capabilities and governance are uneven. A central conclusion is that cooperation, rather than
competition alone, will yield the best outcomes. The alternative – a fragmented world where AI
tools in one country are not trusted in another, or an arms race drives unsafe rapid development
– could lead to conflict and setback. We foresee two divergent scenarios: one in which a set of
shared international norms and possibly accords on AI development emerge (for instance,
agreements on prohibiting certain autonomous weapons or establishing global safety testing
centers for advanced AI), and another in which mistrust prevails and nations treat advanced AI
as the next arena of zero-sum competition. The next 5 years will likely indicate which path we
lean towards. Our research suggests that while competition is inevitable, there is a growing
recognition of shared risk – exemplified by joint calls from Western and Chinese scientists
(www. ft. com). By 2035, we hope to see institutions fulfilling for AI a role similar to the
International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear tech, albeit adapted to the faster,
private-sector-driven, and dual-use nature of AI. In conclusion, a cooperative global approach
enhances not just safety but also the spread of AI s benefits to all corners of the world.
5. Predicting AI s future has inherent uncertainty, so adaptability is key. Finally, we
conclude with humility that our envisioned future is one of many possibilities. One constant,
however, is that change is the norm – be it faster or slower, AI will not stand still. Therefore, the
capacity to adapt – in policies, business models, skillsets, and mindsets – will be decisive in
thriving in the AI era. Societies that are flexible, forward-thinking, and resilient will navigate the
coming changes more successfully. The wise stance is to prepare for multiple outcomes:
optimistic ones where AI largely augments human capabilities and drives a new renaissance,
and cautionary ones where strong oversight and corrections are needed to steer away from
pitfalls. The truth may lie in between, requiring continuous course correction.
In closing, the next decade of AI holds enormous promise. We might be on the cusp of major
advances that significantly improve quality of life, from curing diseases to democratizing
knowledge. Yet, those promised gains will only materialize if we address the accompanying
challenges head-on. The story of AI in 5 and 10 years will not just be written by engineers and
algorithms, but by all of us – through the choices we make in cultivating this technology. Our
collective aim should be to ensure that AI remains aligned with human values and interests,
serving as a tool to empower rather than overpower. If we succeed, the year 2035 could be
remembered as a time when humanity, augmented by its intelligent creations, entered a new era
of prosperity and discovery. If we falter, it could be a time of turmoil and regret. This report
highlights both paths; it is now incumbent upon stakeholders to heed the insights, act wisely,
and shape the future of AI towards the better path.
Areas for Future Research
While this analysis has covered a broad range of topics, it also revealed several areas where
further research is needed to deepen understanding and guide future actions. We identify the
following areas as particularly important for ongoing and future research, given their impact on
AI s trajectory over the next decade:
1. Long-term AI Safety and Alignment: As AI systems become more autonomous and
powerful, ensuring their goals align with human values is paramount. Future research should
focus on technical alignment strategies – for example, developing AI that can explain its
reasoning and accept human feedback iteratively, or creating theoretical frameworks for
verifying an AI s objectives. Multi-disciplinary work combining machine learning with control
theory, ethics, and even cognitive science will be valuable. Moreover, more research is needed
on governance of advanced AI: What organizational structures (international watchdogs, audit
processes) best ensure safe development? This area remains nascent, and scholars in public
policy and law need to collaborate with technologists to propose concrete solutions before truly
general AI emerges.
2. Measuring and Mitigating Bias: Although bias in AI has been acknowledged, methods to
systematically measure and eliminate bias in complex models are still evolving. Research is
needed to create standard benchmarks for fairness across different contexts (what might bias
mean in a lending algorithm vs. a facial recognition system?) and to devise algorithms that can
adjust models to meet fairness criteria without sacrificing too much accuracy.
